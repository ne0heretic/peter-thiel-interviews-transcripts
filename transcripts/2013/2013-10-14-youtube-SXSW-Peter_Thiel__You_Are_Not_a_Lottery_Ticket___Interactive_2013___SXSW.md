[Peter Thiel: You Are Not a Lottery Ticket | Interactive 2013 | SXSW](https://youtu.be/iZM_JmZdqCw)

[00:00:01] I thought I'd sort of take a somewhat different tack today and know try

[00:00:05] to talk a little bit about what I think the biggest single

[00:00:09] philosophical question in all these startups maybe

[00:00:13] even in life generally is that people have and

[00:00:16] it's um it's whether is it

[00:00:20] all just a matter of luck or how much of this is luck and how

[00:00:24] much is not luck when you start one of these businesses

[00:00:27] and and do do one of these things and it's sort of a big

[00:00:31] question that underlies a lot of a lot

[00:00:35] of these different ventures that people do and I want to I want to try

[00:00:39] to tackle that question at least indirectly today I want to talk a

[00:00:42] little bit about you know a little bit about the

[00:00:47] question of luck why it's very hard to answer

[00:00:50] I want to suggest to you that we live in a society where people

[00:00:54] are incredibly biased to thinking that things

[00:00:58] are dominated by luck and I want to at least suggest that there are some

[00:01:02] alternate ways of thinking about the future that it's it's worth

[00:01:05] for us to explore um let

[00:01:09] me let me start with this is probably sort of my my general

[00:01:13] might the general slide that I always

[00:01:17] have on the nature of progress the nature of the future

[00:01:21] and when you think about how the 21st century

[00:01:24] is going to unfold you can think that there are basically two

[00:01:28] axes to the 21st century there's a technology axis

[00:01:32] and a globalization axis they're

[00:01:35] they're very different people always use these words interchangeably but

[00:01:40] globalization is basically about copying

[00:01:43] things that already work it's the story of China

[00:01:47] and the emerging world there's still you know much

[00:01:51] the world six billion out of seven billion people are still incredibly poor

[00:01:55] and what they mainly have to do in the next

[00:01:58] few decades is just copy things that work there's some things

[00:02:02] where they can avoid copying bad ideas from from the developed

[00:02:06] nations but a lot of it is the sort of horizontal or extensive

[00:02:09] progress and sort of going from 1 to N but

[00:02:14] then there's also technology doing new things

[00:02:18] vertical or intensive progress and it's sort of where

[00:02:21] you're the first person or business or

[00:02:25] inventor or artist in the history of

[00:02:29] the world to do to do something new it's going from from zero

[00:02:32] to one and what I want to suggest is that there's

[00:02:36] there is something sort of very different about going from

[00:02:40] zero to one instead of 1

[00:02:43] to N 1 to n is there sort of is this law of large numbers and

[00:02:47] you can sort of run the experiment many times and sort

[00:02:51] of see how things work but you when you go from zero to one

[00:02:55] there's a sense in which you know every

[00:02:58] every sort of event in the history of progress

[00:03:02] in the history of technology or science has something singular

[00:03:06] and non-repeatable about it and so and

[00:03:10] so if we ask you know is a given invention a given

[00:03:13] startup a given artistic achievement was this

[00:03:17] something that would have happened anyway is it something was a total fluke

[00:03:21] it's actually a really hard question to answer because you

[00:03:25] only have sort of a sample size of one to go

[00:03:29] on and you can sort of you can sort of say that that

[00:03:32] with a sample size of one you know the variance

[00:03:36] becomes infinite so it's almost impossible to know whether

[00:03:40] you were lucky or not and I think that's probably

[00:03:44] this sort of important starting point to

[00:03:47] have is that it's completely unclear

[00:03:51] whether or not it's luck or not

[00:03:55] and you can have certain biases on this but in

[00:03:58] anything we're going from zero to one it's very very hard to say

[00:04:02] now um there certainly is some very

[00:04:06] mild anecdotal evidence that that you can

[00:04:10] give that that's certain that the anti

[00:04:13] luck argument is that there are certain people who succeeded in doing

[00:04:17] various businesses on a repeat

[00:04:21] basis you know there's probably perhaps most famously still

[00:04:25] achieved Steve Jobs with you know and Pixar you

[00:04:29] know Jack Dorsey with square Twitter Mike my colleague Elon

[00:04:33] from PayPal who went on to start SpaceX and Tesla was

[00:04:37] heavily involved in Solar City of course

[00:04:40] you know there's always a counter-narrative with these things you can say well this person

[00:04:44] just each of these people had just one big breakthrough and then everything

[00:04:48] else was somehow leveraged off of that and so you know whenever you sort

[00:04:51] of drill down on this question was it luck was it not luck

[00:04:55] it's actually um it's actually really hard it's

[00:04:59] really hard to say it is striking however

[00:05:02] how much the way we talk about this has changed and

[00:05:06] so if you go you know if you go

[00:05:09] back in time the classical way people used

[00:05:13] to talk about it was that luck was something to

[00:05:17] be overcome or to be mastered so you know thomas jefferson i'm

[00:05:21] a great believer in luck and i find the harder I work the more I have

[00:05:24] of it which again suggests that it's it's this it's

[00:05:28] this thing to to overcome or to

[00:05:32] you know that's uh that doesn't dominate things or you know even

[00:05:36] simpler Samuel Goldwyn the harder I work the luckier

[00:05:40] I get I'm very much in contrast

[00:05:44] to that you have something like today's dominant

[00:05:47] view where success stems from sort of this

[00:05:51] whole context the context is random you know

[00:05:55] maybe you were a member of the lucky sperm Club the lucky egg club

[00:05:59] you know you were lucky where you were born and stuff like that

[00:06:02] and that sort of is what drives everything and there's

[00:06:06] a course you know a version of this that applies to startups

[00:06:10] that you know the successful ones were

[00:06:14] accidental you know it's pretty clear

[00:06:17] how big a role luck plays I agree with Paul Graham on an awful

[00:06:21] lot of things but but again I I think this is sort of a place

[00:06:25] where it's just automatically channeling our default

[00:06:29] bias as a society and it's worth asking how

[00:06:33] much of this is true and how much is is not true what

[00:06:37] I want to focus on today is um is not

[00:06:41] so much in those are two different directions

[00:06:45] you can go with this question of luck one is sort of the past orientation

[00:06:49] which is you know how did I get here you know what

[00:06:53] were the factors that contributed to to success

[00:06:56] but I want to focus instead on instead

[00:07:01] I want to focus on the future question of of what

[00:07:05] you know what you can do next and where you go where

[00:07:09] you go from here is this is there

[00:07:12] sort of is is and is the future

[00:07:16] is that something that's fundamentally

[00:07:21] dominated by chance or is somehow thinking of this is

[00:07:24] being dominant by chance somewhat of a

[00:07:28] somewhat of a wrong way or an incomplete

[00:07:32] way to think about the future and want to offer the alternate and alternate

[00:07:35] perspective on that now I want to say a little bit

[00:07:39] about the structure of the future and how

[00:07:43] people can think about the future and and you can think

[00:07:47] of it I think most simply as being determinate or indeterminate and

[00:07:51] in particular I have the sort of two-by-two

[00:07:55] matrix for the future it's sort of a consulting type

[00:07:58] type idea but you can basically on

[00:08:02] most simplistically you can say that the future

[00:08:06] is either optimistic or pessimistic and it's

[00:08:10] either determinate or indeterminate an optimistic

[00:08:14] future is one where you believe things will be

[00:08:18] better than the present on whatever axis

[00:08:21] defines better a pessimistic future

[00:08:25] is one where you think things will generally be worse and

[00:08:28] then a determinant future is one where you can sort of map

[00:08:32] out reasonable amounts of it and and plan against

[00:08:36] it and then an indeterminate one is a is

[00:08:40] where you have absolutely no clue and it's or just a random

[00:08:44] walk all the way certainly

[00:08:48] depending on which of these quadrants you believe

[00:08:52] is basically correct out the future it tells you

[00:08:55] some very different at least some very different approaches that you would

[00:08:59] pursue in terms of how you think about your life or

[00:09:03] the kinds of things you're doing and I want to sort of try

[00:09:06] to develop this framework a little bit more as we as we as

[00:09:10] we think about this so for example most

[00:09:14] simply on a determinant versus indeterminate

[00:09:18] axis you know if you

[00:09:21] believe the future is determinate

[00:09:25] you will act with with some degree of conviction

[00:09:29] you'll have specific ideas and you'll have some confidence to

[00:09:33] to to work towards those ideas

[00:09:37] if it is indeterminate on the

[00:09:41] number one rule is to diversify because you have no idea

[00:09:45] what's going to work and you should just try lots of different things and

[00:09:48] should have some sort of a portfolio approach to the future

[00:09:52] and so I think one of the things that's always very interesting when you think of this determinate

[00:09:55] versus indeterminate thing is that all these things that ultimately become self-fulfilling

[00:09:59] so if you if you think it's determinate and then you

[00:10:03] focus on doing one thing extremely well that sort

[00:10:07] of leads to conviction and then maybe that becomes self-fulfilling if

[00:10:10] you think that it's fundamentally indeterminate you end up with

[00:10:14] a portfolio approach it's diversified and it has maybe that

[00:10:18] itself becomes self-fulfilling and becomes somewhat indeterminate

[00:10:22] and it becomes more indeterminate in a way um there's

[00:10:26] of course on you know on the optimistic versus pessimistic axis

[00:10:29] the simple one is just you know are you fundamentally afraid

[00:10:33] of it do you think it's fundamentally something that's going to be

[00:10:37] better and these sorts of perspectives also lead

[00:10:41] to very different ways to act if you want to if you want to put this in

[00:10:44] sort of a historical context I think that

[00:10:49] I'm going to try to develop explain why I put these

[00:10:52] different zones in these quadrants but I think the u.s. in the 50s

[00:10:56] and 60s and maybe even before then was fundamentally optimistic and

[00:11:00] determinate the future was clearly going to be better people

[00:11:04] thought that every generation was going to be better off the generation came before

[00:11:07] and it was for the most part in very specific ways

[00:11:11] there was a there was a determinate way in which the

[00:11:15] frontier was going to be developed there was a way that you

[00:11:18] know cars would get faster planes would get faster rockets

[00:11:22] would get faster there was sort of all these very specific

[00:11:26] ways that the future would get better from

[00:11:30] year to year and decade to decade I

[00:11:33] think is sort of a very different paradigm

[00:11:37] that the US had for a quarter century from 1982 to 2007

[00:11:41] where the future was going to be better that was the official

[00:11:45] religion it was still sort of very optimistic

[00:11:49] but if you asked how or why people had no good

[00:11:53] answer for it and so it was just this this mechanistic thing that

[00:11:56] would automatically get better in one form another and so we were sort

[00:12:00] of in this quadrant of extreme indeterminate

[00:12:04] optimism I would say for about a quarter of a century from

[00:12:08] the period of 82 to 2007 an

[00:12:12] indeterminate pessimism is probably what characterizes

[00:12:16] most of the rest of the developed world I would say Japan's

[00:12:20] been in this zone for for

[00:12:23] the last the last 20 years people have a sense the

[00:12:27] future is going to be not that great maybe a little bit worse and

[00:12:31] nobody has an idea of what to do and I think sort of Europe has

[00:12:34] weirdly drifted into this indeterminate pessimistic quadrant as

[00:12:38] well where people think the future is worse but nobody has any idea what

[00:12:42] to do um you can sort of argue where you put China

[00:12:46] on this some people would put in the determinate optimistic quadrant

[00:12:50] I tend to put it on the determinant

[00:12:53] pessimistic quadrant it's very determinate people in China have a they

[00:12:57] know what it's going to look like in 20 years they're going to build out the highways

[00:13:01] in the cities and for the most part it's it I

[00:13:04] think it is going to be a somewhat poorer version of the

[00:13:08] developed world people will get old before they get rich there's a very specific

[00:13:12] way to to track against that but

[00:13:15] China comes out on this quadrant that's very different

[00:13:19] from the you 80222 2000-2007

[00:13:23] if you if you think of these quadrants in terms

[00:13:27] of in terms of the

[00:13:32] sort of a financial way you could describe this which is that if

[00:13:36] you're optimistic you don't need to save a lot

[00:13:39] of money if you're pessimistic you save a lot of money so if

[00:13:43] you're super optimistic you know the future is going to be better

[00:13:46] there's no need to save any money and so

[00:13:50] you end up with a savings rate that's that's very

[00:13:54] low if you include a government borrowing in the u.s. today

[00:13:58] the u.s. savings rate today stands at minus 6% so

[00:14:02] we're still incredibly optimistic about the future we don't need to save

[00:14:06] any money because the future will automatically be better and so we're still maybe

[00:14:09] in an Indian summer of indeterminate optimism on

[00:14:14] the other hand for example I would describe China's quite pessimistic

[00:14:17] because it has a savings rate of something close to on

[00:14:21] 30 30 percent of GDP gets saved and so

[00:14:24] people even though there's some ways in which things are getting better

[00:14:28] from year to year people still think they'll be old

[00:14:32] before they get rich and therefore they need to save a lot of money so you have this

[00:14:35] low savings to high savings access from optimism

[00:14:39] to pessimism and then if you sort of that's like investing

[00:14:43] in cash or bonds or things like that

[00:14:47] saving in cash or bonds or things like that if you invest

[00:14:51] in specific things there's specific company's

[00:14:55] buildings ideas you invest in if you

[00:14:58] have a definite determinate view you'll have a high investment rate

[00:15:02] if it's indeterminate you will not know what specific

[00:15:06] things to invest in and so you end up with a low low

[00:15:09] investment on low investment rate and so

[00:15:13] so one of the strange things about

[00:15:17] indeterminate optimism is that it's the quadrant

[00:15:21] that has both low savings and low investment and

[00:15:25] the question I will come back to towards the end is whether that's a

[00:15:28] state that's whether that's a stable quadrant at all is it possible for the future

[00:15:32] to be better when no one saves and no one invests because no

[00:15:36] one's thinking and everyone's outsourcing all the thinking to other people

[00:15:40] one of the other ways you can sort of describe this difference

[00:15:44] on I want to give a few different axes for describing this shift

[00:15:48] from determinate to indeterminate ways of the future the mathematical

[00:15:52] version is that the dominant form of mathematics used to

[00:15:55] be calculus and it's shifted to probability and statistics

[00:15:59] the structural way is that

[00:16:03] in a determinant world you're focused on substance there are some specific

[00:16:07] substantive things you focus on in an indeterminant

[00:16:10] world all that you end up focusing on are processes and

[00:16:14] so what people talk about our world is what's the process

[00:16:18] for doing thing something much more than what is the specific

[00:16:22] thing you're trying to do to talk about specific things is to definite

[00:16:25] and that seems to two to weirdly to

[00:16:29] weirdly wrong in practice you can sort of think of these

[00:16:33] very different types of quadrants that dominate the indeterminate

[00:16:36] optimistic world is dominated by finance and law because

[00:16:40] these are the kinds of process oriented disciplines

[00:16:44] that that you pursue if you have no idea about the future

[00:16:48] if it's fundamentally about making sure that the

[00:16:52] piping of the system it works but you have the sense the system just sort

[00:16:56] of works automatically on in a determinate

[00:17:00] optimistic world that's probably a world in which there's much more

[00:17:03] room for engineering art you know very specific

[00:17:07] things it's people who have ideas about the future that are radically

[00:17:11] different from the present it's people who have dreams about

[00:17:15] the future that nobody else shares and that

[00:17:18] they're you know willing to work towards and where the dreams of

[00:17:22] a substantive Lee different and radically better world are

[00:17:26] not subsumed towards some sort of random process

[00:17:30] you know determinate pessimistic would be wartime rationing

[00:17:34] you know indeterminate pessimistic all you end up doing is

[00:17:37] buying insurance I've spoken in some context about to

[00:17:42] being a bubble in education and I think you can think of the education

[00:17:46] bubble a form of indeterminate pessimism

[00:17:50] where people are they don't really know what the education is

[00:17:53] for but it's fundamentally acts as an insurance policy to

[00:17:57] avoid falling through the larger and larger cracks in our society and

[00:18:01] so anyway you can sort of think about these different quadrants and depending

[00:18:05] on which one dominates there's sort of very different kinds of industries that

[00:18:09] that end up dominating you know to have a picture

[00:18:13] of what definite optimism or determinate optimism

[00:18:16] looked like you know we can we can go back

[00:18:20] to these classic examples from from US history

[00:18:24] so there are things like like

[00:18:27] the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad in the in

[00:18:31] the 19th century uh where it

[00:18:35] was a radically different future where the world you

[00:18:39] know would be connected it's a gigantic undertaking by today's

[00:18:43] standards nobody would do it people would say why are you building this railroad

[00:18:46] to nowhere it doesn't make any sense it's costing

[00:18:50] too much money but somehow as

[00:18:54] it was built the future sort of took care of itself

[00:18:58] you know the classic mid 20th century example I always like

[00:19:02] to cite is Robert Moses who was

[00:19:05] this some somewhat forgotten figure

[00:19:09] he was probably the most important person in in New York more

[00:19:14] powerful than the mayor or the governor of New York City New

[00:19:17] York State respectively for about a quarter century he started by becoming

[00:19:21] the parks commissioner he ended up having seventeen different

[00:19:24] positions in government and he sort of show up with his bulldozer

[00:19:28] and build parks and levels and neighborhoods and build some

[00:19:32] highways people could have access to the parks he built all the sort of roadways

[00:19:36] on Long Island the FDR expressway and there was sort of you

[00:19:39] know one thing after another that got rebuilt it sort of stopped

[00:19:43] in the mid 1960s when he planned to build a highway

[00:19:47] connecting Brooklyn in New Jersey it was going to go through the southern end

[00:19:50] of Manhattan they're going to sort of raise Greenwich Village to the ground the

[00:19:55] neighbors sort of objected they started saying we're not quite sure that

[00:19:59] the future actually is be better than the present there's gonna be this highway with sort of

[00:20:02] skyscrapers right on top of the highway and and

[00:20:06] it's sort of it sort of stopped and at that point

[00:20:10] people basically you know what and once

[00:20:14] there was no longer a definite view of the future

[00:20:17] you also ended up with a place where people stopped building

[00:20:21] things in New York and so it's possible that Moses was very

[00:20:24] wrong that most of the things were misdirected but it did have this sort

[00:20:28] of powerful coordinating function and and once

[00:20:32] the idea of the future disappeared and people no longer believed

[00:20:35] that there was a future that was that looked very different from the

[00:20:39] present and that was radically better than the present people

[00:20:43] stopped being able to build anything and nothing new

[00:20:46] an infrastructure sense has been built in New York State

[00:20:50] for close to half a century on any meaningful scale

[00:20:54] again to sort of illustrate how different

[00:20:58] past ideas of the future were for those of

[00:21:01] those those of you familiar with the San Francisco Bay Area there

[00:21:05] was this thing called the rubber plan up in sort of the

[00:21:09] late 1940s it was a plan to basically build two

[00:21:14] large earth and Rockville dams one was between Marin

[00:21:17] County and Richmond the other between San Francisco and Oakland

[00:21:21] it was going to turn on the North Bay in the South Bay into

[00:21:25] two giant freshwater lakes there'd be 20,000

[00:21:29] acres of new landfill there's going to be a 32 lane

[00:21:33] highway built around the entire Bay Area and

[00:21:37] you have sort of 30 story skyscrapers built around the

[00:21:40] entire San Francisco Bay you know rubber was sort

[00:21:44] of a schoolteacher amateur theater producer but

[00:21:47] in the world of the 1950s this idea was taken seriously

[00:21:51] enough that you had congressional hearings there was you know a giant mock-up

[00:21:55] of the plan it was concluded there would be too much of operation and wouldn't quite

[00:21:59] work and so people sort of gave up on it after a while

[00:22:03] but again you cannot even imagine someone

[00:22:07] someone who's a schoolteacher and amateur theater

[00:22:11] producer being able to have a plan

[00:22:15] to just re-engineer a huge geographical area

[00:22:19] like this and and change and change the world in

[00:22:22] a in a radical way this is again sort of where we're in this world

[00:22:26] that's extremely different from the world of just 50 or 60 years ago

[00:22:30] and of course you know all the classic

[00:22:34] all the classic versions of science

[00:22:38] fiction cities underwater cities on the moon cities

[00:22:42] on Mars cities in outer space sort of radically different

[00:22:46] and very definite ideas of the future that

[00:22:50] would sort of become self-fulfilling prophecies of one sort or another

[00:22:53] and when you sort of look at these pictures today

[00:22:57] these things look they don't look futuristic they

[00:23:01] look dated they look like they look like they really are

[00:23:05] sort of from the past which

[00:23:08] is sort of a against for this very strange way in which things have changed

[00:23:12] um you know the classic by contrast

[00:23:16] the classic version of indefinite optimism

[00:23:19] is a portfolio investing theory it

[00:23:23] is that you should invest in a in a

[00:23:28] stock market index that's the way you get the highest risk adjusted

[00:23:31] returns because the motion of stocks

[00:23:35] is like the movement of atoms in the universe it's fundamentally random and

[00:23:38] we can't know anything about it we can just actually we

[00:23:42] can maybe describe the laws the statistical laws that describe the randomness

[00:23:46] but what specific stocks or specific companies or

[00:23:49] specific projects you should invest in you can never know

[00:23:53] and but you know the stock market generally moves in a

[00:23:57] in a northeasterly direction and therefore the most important

[00:24:01] thing is to find the way to get maximum diversification at

[00:24:04] minimum cost and and do something like a portfolio

[00:24:08] investing you know in this ship one of the

[00:24:12] strange things that happens in the shift from definite to

[00:24:15] indefinite views of the future is that there is this shift from engineering

[00:24:19] to finance and and and one of

[00:24:23] the things that happens is that money somehow becomes much

[00:24:26] more important and so the soundbite version of this is in

[00:24:30] a definite world money is a means to an end because there are specific

[00:24:34] things you want to do with money in an indefinite world you

[00:24:37] have no idea what to do with money and some money simply becomes an end

[00:24:41] in itself which seems always a little bit perverse you just accumulate

[00:24:45] money and you have no idea what to do with it that seems for like a bit

[00:24:49] of a crazy thing to do but I think that's actually what

[00:24:53] what happens a great deal and so to illustrate one way that

[00:24:57] this flow might happen if you you know start a successful business

[00:25:01] you know you sell the company or you sell

[00:25:04] shares to investors in an IPO you make some money question

[00:25:09] what do you do with the money you have no idea because nobody

[00:25:12] knows what to do with anything and so you give the money to a large bank

[00:25:16] to help you do something what does the bank do it has

[00:25:20] no idea so it gives the money to a portfolio of

[00:25:23] institutional investors what do the instance each institutional

[00:25:27] investor do they have no idea and so

[00:25:31] they all just invest in a portfolio of stocks not too much in any single

[00:25:35] stock ever because that suggests you have opinions or you

[00:25:39] have ideas and that's very dangerous because it suggests that you're somehow

[00:25:42] not with it and then what do the companies do that get the money

[00:25:46] they've been told that all they should do is generate free cash flows

[00:25:50] because if they were to actually invest the money in specific

[00:25:54] things that would suggest the companies had ideas about the future and that

[00:25:57] would be very dangerous and so one of the worst things you can ever have is a company

[00:26:01] that's uh that's not profitable in in in

[00:26:05] this indefinite world and sort of the the contrarian idea that I always

[00:26:09] like saying is that we always like investing in companies that are losing

[00:26:13] money we don't like investing in companies that are making money because the

[00:26:16] companies that are not profitable are actually the companies that have

[00:26:20] a lot of ideas about what to do with their money whereas a company

[00:26:24] that's massively profitable on some level is a company that's

[00:26:27] out of ideas and it's especially crazy in a world

[00:26:31] where on where the interest rates are zero and you actually

[00:26:34] get paid less and less on the money and then of course the companies are profitable

[00:26:38] to generate cash flows the cash flows eventually go back to people and you

[00:26:42] sort of cycle and repeat and this is sort of this

[00:26:45] is the rough flow that happens in the world of indefinite

[00:26:49] optimism on the problem is you

[00:26:53] know it's somewhat of a you know this is a bit of an extreme picture but

[00:26:56] in effect it's a hermetically closed loop and at

[00:27:00] the end of the day no one's doing anything real with the money it's

[00:27:04] completely abstracted and what ends up happening is

[00:27:08] there are fewer and fewer things you can do and and one

[00:27:12] of the one of the sort of financial ways to illustrate this is

[00:27:16] if you look at the real interest rates on a 10-year

[00:27:20] bonds in the US which is this is a measure of how much

[00:27:24] interest you earn on bonds - what

[00:27:27] the expected inflation rate is and it's basically

[00:27:31] been trending steadily downwards today it's at

[00:27:35] minus 0.6 percent so 10-year bonds are yielding about 2%

[00:27:39] the expected inflation for the next decade is 2.6

[00:27:43] percent so when you invest in bonds in real terms you're expecting

[00:27:47] to lose minus 0.6 percent a year for a decade

[00:27:51] and it shouldn't even be surprising because

[00:27:55] there's no one in the system who has any idea what to do with the money this

[00:27:59] has been sort of a consistent critique of the huge

[00:28:03] deficits the US is running people constantly are saying you know there's a

[00:28:06] point where the bond market is going to blow up and the interest rates will go higher and

[00:28:10] one of the really big mysteries is that this has not happened for

[00:28:14] year after year and I think the the fundamental the

[00:28:17] fundamental reason this has not happened is that people

[00:28:21] actually have no idea what to do with the money the last

[00:28:25] big idea people had on what to do with money

[00:28:28] that was not sort of circular was to buy houses and

[00:28:32] to invest in housing and that was sort of the decade the idea of the last decade that

[00:28:36] idea has gone out of fashion now that people no longer want to

[00:28:39] buy houses they have absolutely no ideas what to do with money the

[00:28:43] interest rates the real interest rates are going steadily more negative

[00:28:47] and so there's some sense in which this system of

[00:28:51] indefinite optimism is on is gradually

[00:28:55] sort of running out there's

[00:28:58] a way in which um you know what

[00:29:02] the the natural drift is for something from finance

[00:29:06] to insurance I attend to all I'm not going to give

[00:29:10] my whole anti Warren Buffett lecture here but

[00:29:13] I think I think there's a way in which Buffett was prescient

[00:29:17] and ahead of the curve and basically we oriented

[00:29:21] most of his businesses towards insurance companies in disguise which

[00:29:25] is sort of the world of indefinite pessimism and that's what

[00:29:28] what dominates in that sort of world and we can sort of see

[00:29:32] how this indeterminacy affects us in very

[00:29:36] very many different fields so if we look at politics in an

[00:29:39] indeterminate world the most important

[00:29:43] position in politics is the pollster and what

[00:29:47] do you do in politics nobody has a clue but what you do is

[00:29:50] you take a poll and and the polls tell you

[00:29:54] what to do they don't really tell you anything on a long-term basis but

[00:29:57] they sort of tell you incrementally what you do at any any given

[00:30:01] time and and as we've tracked towards us more and more indeterminate

[00:30:06] world there's a way in which you know Paul taking has become more

[00:30:10] and more dominant and so the way we talk about political

[00:30:13] campaigns and elections is sort

[00:30:17] of how are people doing in the polls much more than

[00:30:21] what ideas they're talking it's sort of you know if Martin Luther King were here

[00:30:25] and said I have a dream about a future that's really different

[00:30:28] you know the question with how does that poll um

[00:30:33] it's a it would never and and that's sort of the

[00:30:36] way we avoid this there obviously are cases where this goes very badly wrong

[00:30:40] my sort of Exhibit A and my apology to all the Palin

[00:30:43] fans and the audience here but but but you

[00:30:47] know people always say it's this incredible mystery why McCain picked Palin

[00:30:51] in 2008 I think it's not a mystery at all on the

[00:30:55] basic heuristic was that you you looked at all the Republican

[00:30:58] senators and governors in 2008 Republicans weren't very

[00:31:02] popular they're mostly running around 40% in the polls Palin

[00:31:06] was at 85 in Alaska because when oil was

[00:31:10] $140 a barrel Alaska was like Kuwait everybody was getting huge

[00:31:14] checks from the government at state of Alaska she was pulling extremely well and so

[00:31:18] there was no question that you would go with the person

[00:31:22] who pulled the highest and so you went with you went with Palin

[00:31:25] even though perhaps it couldn't scale to the US as a whole because

[00:31:29] the US was not producing way more oil than it was consuming

[00:31:33] and so you know and then there's sort of our ways in which

[00:31:37] you know the 2012 re-election gets recast as a contract

[00:31:41] contest between say nate silver and dick morris silver was

[00:31:44] a better poll taker and so he won rather than that

[00:31:48] obama had better ideas or the ideas resonated better or that's what people

[00:31:52] wanted to hear it's not the substantive way that we talk about politics

[00:31:56] um to talk about government more generally you

[00:32:00] know even though government spending is still about the same as it has been

[00:32:04] for the last 50 or 60 years as a percent of GDP more

[00:32:08] and more of it is shifted towards transfer payments which are of

[00:32:11] course a way of saying that the government has no ideas and what to do

[00:32:15] with money it simply moves it to other people and people it's

[00:32:19] assumed that people have ideas but you don't have specific ideas

[00:32:23] of what to do there is a way in which you can see indeterminacy

[00:32:27] in literature sort of if you sort of take a some you know classic

[00:32:31] science fiction the 1960s

[00:32:34] Space Odyssey classic you know the text was updated automatically

[00:32:38] every hour one could spend entire lifetime doing nothing but X orbing the ever-changing flow

[00:32:42] of information from a new satellite so a specific definite view

[00:32:46] of a radically different future which you know maps

[00:32:49] reasonably closely to today's internet Neuromancer

[00:32:53] 1984 the sky above the port was the color of television tuned

[00:32:57] to a dead Channel future is fundamentally static

[00:33:03] if you think of it in terms of philosophy

[00:33:08] there's sort of our different ways to to map these

[00:33:12] quadrants but I would say the optimistic indeterminate

[00:33:16] quadrant is fundamentally the quadrant

[00:33:20] of someone like Rawls or Nozick people only think of them as

[00:33:24] opposites but they're they're really both in the same category

[00:33:28] Nozick it's sort of the libertarian version you have no idea what

[00:33:32] to do and therefore the individual is paramount Rawls you're

[00:33:36] an avail of ignorance you have no idea what society you will be born

[00:33:39] in and therefore social democracy is paramount you get two very different

[00:33:43] ideas but they both take their starting point from sort

[00:33:47] of complete indeterminacy about the state of the world the

[00:33:51] classic determinate one you could be on the left you could be on the right but

[00:33:54] it was there was some sort of sort of Marx Hegel

[00:33:58] all these people where there was you know even going back to bacon or Locke

[00:34:02] there was some sort of definite way that things would would

[00:34:06] get better and you could sort of work towards

[00:34:10] a better future in one way or another and then

[00:34:14] of course you have the determinate pessimistic indeterminate

[00:34:18] pessimistic you think tend to be more classical ones the determinant pessimistic

[00:34:23] would be like Plato and Aristotle there's a definite way things happen

[00:34:26] even though there's sort of limits and you can't be too hopeful about technology

[00:34:30] you're really improving the state of the world in any fundamental way and

[00:34:33] then probably the classic version

[00:34:37] of indeterminate pessimism and I think this is sort of the philosophical category

[00:34:41] that we're back in is sort of the epicurean Lucretia's view

[00:34:44] of the universe where there is nothing but atoms and the void the

[00:34:48] atoms randomly move throughout the void they run sometimes bump

[00:34:52] into each other stuff happens eventually they break apart things

[00:34:55] fall apart chance roads everything there's

[00:34:59] nothing specifically you can do that makes any sense everything

[00:35:04] event you know things sort of all go to pot marijuana farming

[00:35:07] might be a good thing to go into in this world but

[00:35:11] basically this is actually this is actually in

[00:35:15] some ways become the dominant the dominant

[00:35:19] view and it ends up being sort of strangely stoic because

[00:35:23] there's really nothing you can do about these larger forces that

[00:35:27] that will ultimately buffett you in the the most you can hope to

[00:35:30] achieve the certain amount of equanimity and indifference about

[00:35:34] fundamental randomness and meaninglessness of the

[00:35:38] universe you know indeterminacy

[00:35:42] and death we think about the process of aging

[00:35:45] and death very differently from the way we used to sort of the classic

[00:35:49] early science version was that death was a specific problem

[00:35:53] to be solved there were specific diseases to solve specific ways

[00:35:57] to conquer death on the

[00:36:01] contemporary way to think about it is fundamentally through the

[00:36:05] prism of insurance which is again sort of indeterminate more on the pessimistic

[00:36:09] side and the main thing we can do is the actuarial math you

[00:36:13] know what is the probability that you are going to die in a given year if

[00:36:17] you are that old so if you're 30 years old you have about a 1,000

[00:36:20] chance of dying in the next year if you're 80 years old you have

[00:36:24] a 1 in 10 chance of dying in the next year and and

[00:36:29] all we can do is sort of describe these these

[00:36:32] probabilities and I'm not saying that you know by the way that this probabilistic

[00:36:36] view has nothing to it I just want to sort of illustrate how it

[00:36:40] sort of dominates our thinking and so instead of

[00:36:43] trying to find a cure for death or a solution

[00:36:47] to the problem of aging the best we can hope to do is figure out

[00:36:51] better ways to calculate the probabilities better ways to give people

[00:36:54] cell people various life insurance policies and

[00:36:58] and thereby suggest the sort of

[00:37:01] pseudo mastery of a process that's fundamentally

[00:37:05] random and indeterminate of course

[00:37:09] you know the basic problem is that eventually the luck runs

[00:37:13] out oops you

[00:37:16] see how this works

[00:39:25] so anyway um you

[00:39:29] know at some point your luck runs out

[00:39:33] and so I think I think this question of whether

[00:39:38] you know indeterminate optimism is possible

[00:39:42] in the long run is this is this core question and is

[00:39:45] something like this this frame that we've had where it's just one

[00:39:49] coin toss after another and you know

[00:39:53] you're probably not going to die in the next hour or the next

[00:39:56] six months you'll probably be lucky it will probably land heads for

[00:40:00] the time being but you never think very far about

[00:40:04] the future is that actually an ultimately stable quadrant

[00:40:08] or not and so so you know if you want to sort of frame

[00:40:12] this as a general question it's you could say you know could

[00:40:16] an iterative process lead if not the best of all possible worlds at

[00:40:19] least to a world where there's a path of monotonic and potentially

[00:40:23] never-ending improvement that's sort of a the core idea of this

[00:40:27] of this world of indeterminate or indefinite optimism

[00:40:31] on you know the paradigmatic Pro

[00:40:35] an indeterminate optimist example is Darwin in Darwin's

[00:40:38] theory of evolution where you know you basically over billions of

[00:40:42] years develop this proliferation of different life forms

[00:40:46] and that's sort of the that's the paradigmatic example

[00:40:49] that we apply to all these different fields and we think

[00:40:53] that things like that work now I do think there are some paradigmatic

[00:40:57] counter examples the one that I want to sort of highlight

[00:41:01] is the paradigmatic counter example of failed

[00:41:05] in determinism are is failed cities and

[00:41:09] and you can sort of you can certainly give various

[00:41:13] examples there's you know Los Angeles which probably should have

[00:41:16] been the greatest city in the United States with you know fantastic weather

[00:41:20] and somehow you know everything gradually went

[00:41:24] wrong with the sprawl LA is still one of the better places in the world

[00:41:27] you know there's the example of South Paulo I was there

[00:41:31] for a day about a year ago it's about a 12 mile

[00:41:35] drive from the main downtown area to the airport it

[00:41:38] takes about 35 minutes if there's no traffic for hours if

[00:41:42] there's traffic on the nine lane highways sort of take the helicopter

[00:41:46] at dusk which is sort of endless lines of red lit cars

[00:41:50] backed up bumper-to-bumper on it's sort of 30 million

[00:41:54] people living in enclaves of a quarter to half a million each

[00:41:58] and of course how Paulo is still you know vastly better than

[00:42:02] places like Mumbai or Lagos Nigeria

[00:42:06] or places like that and if you had to sort of

[00:42:09] give a single reason why the convergence theory

[00:42:13] of globalization is probably going to fail is that most

[00:42:17] cities in the developing world looks something like this

[00:42:20] and and they will not actually be improved in any

[00:42:24] incremental step-by-step way sorry

[00:42:29] there's there's no actual incremental way to to

[00:42:33] improve something something like this and

[00:42:36] you know if you look at the populations most of the people the world at this

[00:42:40] point are are living in these sorts of places

[00:42:44] the the sort of policy debates we have at this point are

[00:42:47] things like economics versus environmentalism

[00:42:51] which we we describe as these radically different perspectives

[00:42:55] on the world but they're really just differing views of different

[00:42:59] indefinite futures as a sort of maybe economics

[00:43:03] can be a little bit more optimistic environmentalism is a little bit more pessimistic

[00:43:06] I personally think that as long as that's the frame

[00:43:10] environmentalism will always win because indefinite

[00:43:14] you know optimism is unstable and the ecological critique

[00:43:18] of economic thinking is that is that the

[00:43:23] economist says we don't need to think about the environment because people

[00:43:26] will solve problems every step of the way and then the counter-argument

[00:43:30] is this this probably does not work but of course the the

[00:43:34] issue with both is that somehow you're subject to these these much

[00:43:37] much larger forces it's the market its nature they're

[00:43:42] fundamentally a sort of random unknowable statistical

[00:43:46] and and you can't think about them coherently one way or

[00:43:50] another and of course this kind of approach

[00:43:53] is also sort of very endemic to the

[00:43:57] way people think about when they start businesses just to sort of segue

[00:44:01] back to that and what one sees

[00:44:04] most commonly are sort of this this methodology where

[00:44:08] you have no idea what you're doing but it should

[00:44:12] basically be a never-ending form

[00:44:16] of a be testing on Darwinistic a be

[00:44:20] testing might work if you have billions of years but in practice you

[00:44:23] tend to run out of money well before then and the problem is

[00:44:27] that somehow the search space of

[00:44:31] all businesses is much bigger than the search space of

[00:44:35] great businesses so it's somehow the a/b testing I think generally

[00:44:39] is a somewhat too inefficient process and the sort of iteration

[00:44:43] process but you end up with this question you just end up on some very low-hanging

[00:44:47] hill where the iteration is going to do something that incrementally improves

[00:44:50] things at every step in time but you maybe you just

[00:44:54] end up you know in a slightly better part of an infinitely

[00:44:58] large slum or something like that to use the failed

[00:45:01] city example there's a machine learning and there's sort of all these

[00:45:05] different ways where you do not think about the future it's most character

[00:45:09] strongly characterized I think in a way by the very short time

[00:45:12] horizons and I think one of the things that's true both on the startup

[00:45:16] side and that may be even more true on the side of people who invest in

[00:45:19] startups is that anything that takes longer than a

[00:45:23] year is considered unreal and fake because we can have no

[00:45:26] opinions about the future and so everything has to be on a super

[00:45:30] short time horizon and and and

[00:45:34] we're sort of dominated by by people who do

[00:45:38] these kinds of things and there's a question you know how

[00:45:42] well how well does this actually work and this is this is this

[00:45:46] is the official religion that we have today

[00:45:50] and I'm not you know I'm I

[00:45:53] don't believe in the official religion on but

[00:45:57] I think you know I think I just want I want people just to at least

[00:46:01] be aware that is this is the religion that that

[00:46:05] it's all statistical it's all luck driven and I

[00:46:09] do think the the most striking thing is that the most

[00:46:13] successful businesses in some ways don't quite seem

[00:46:17] to fit this pattern even though you know

[00:46:20] we we end up talking about it and so you know the

[00:46:24] you know the you know after the 2007

[00:46:28] crash we have seen this return to technology but

[00:46:32] it was characterized by it was most characterized

[00:46:36] by businesses that had very definite ideas I think the the iconic

[00:46:40] one for for the last number of years at least

[00:46:44] till jobs passed away was Apple which was of course

[00:46:48] very much the opposite of you know an indeterminate

[00:46:53] business Apple was one where there was a multi-year vision

[00:46:56] of the future that was sort of being executed against there

[00:47:00] are legitimate concerns whether it still has that vision now that jobs is

[00:47:04] is no longer there but that's really what what is going on and

[00:47:07] of course that's not really the way we typically talk about it

[00:47:11] we typically talk about it and we look at you know how mean Jobs

[00:47:14] was to all the employees and and so we you know they're

[00:47:18] people I know who are running businesses and they sort of hand out

[00:47:22] they hound out hand out books describing how bad jobs

[00:47:25] was to his employees to make their employees feel better about themselves

[00:47:29] and and so and and I think

[00:47:33] the the real question you need to ask about something like Apple is

[00:47:36] you know why did the people put up with this bad behavior

[00:47:40] and I think it was because it was actually this very countervailing

[00:47:44] narrative of the future that in a determinate world you

[00:47:48] know one of the most important metrics is the robustness of the plan what

[00:47:52] I often call the secret plan that you're working against on you

[00:47:56] know the the kinds of companies that we've looked

[00:48:00] at it founders spend over the years the ones that have done best and want been ones that have somehow

[00:48:04] tracked against this this very very long-term

[00:48:07] vision of the future and I think sort of

[00:48:11] the one the one closing thought I would have on this

[00:48:15] is that on the one most characteristic

[00:48:19] thing of companies with a plan is that they

[00:48:23] do not sell and it there often

[00:48:26] are times that you should sell businesses you know I started PayPal there were reasons

[00:48:30] that we there were reasons that it was the right decision for

[00:48:34] us to sell the business when we did in 2002 to eBay

[00:48:37] but but I do think that the most successful businesses

[00:48:42] somehow have an idea of the future that's uh

[00:48:45] that's very different from the present it's not fully

[00:48:49] valued and and therefore there's there's

[00:48:53] no point at at which you you should sell I've

[00:48:56] told this anecdote before but the the most

[00:49:00] important moment in my mind in the history of Facebook

[00:49:04] occurred in July of 2006 the company

[00:49:08] had been around for about two years at the time was still just

[00:49:12] a college site there may be eight or nine million

[00:49:16] people on the site the revenues were I think tracking

[00:49:20] to about thirty million no profits and we

[00:49:24] got we received an acquisition offer from Yahoo for a billion dollars

[00:49:28] and so we had the board meeting on

[00:49:31] Monday morning on in July 2006

[00:49:36] or three of us on the board Zuckerberg myself Jim Brier and

[00:49:40] and you know full disclosure I think that both

[00:49:44] Breyer and myself on balance

[00:49:47] thought we probably should take the money and run

[00:49:51] but but you know Zuckerberg started the meeting

[00:49:55] and first thing he said was well you know

[00:49:58] it's kind of a formality we have to have a quick board meeting

[00:50:02] shouldn't take more than 10 minutes you know we're obviously not going

[00:50:06] to sell here and then we say well you know which actually talked about this

[00:50:09] a little bit more you know a billion dollars is a lot of money and we

[00:50:13] in some ways we hashed the entire the entire discussion

[00:50:17] we had today here these are like you know you know you own

[00:50:21] like 25 percent the company there's so much you could do with all the money you'd

[00:50:24] make well I don't really know what I do with the money

[00:50:28] I just start another social networking site but I

[00:50:32] kind of like the one I already have so why should I sell and

[00:50:37] it was in some way sort of an encapsulation of

[00:50:40] this of this entire of this entire

[00:50:44] discussion and of course some you know you never

[00:50:47] sort of know that the immediate aftermath was that there

[00:50:51] was you know an almost you know infinite

[00:50:55] number of not infinite but there was sort of a large number of

[00:50:59] you know sort of stories about how

[00:51:02] you know how in the world could you have a CEO who was so

[00:51:06] crazy that he wouldn't sell the company who didn't know that you should

[00:51:10] take a billion dollars this is what you got when you had some who's twenty two

[00:51:13] years old when you didn't have any adults in the company on you

[00:51:17] know it probably you know it was just the worst decision anybody had ever

[00:51:21] made the best best rash you know I was

[00:51:24] a little bit worried about it we had you know the the sort of Founders

[00:51:28] Fund ideology we had was that we should always back the CEO

[00:51:32] we should always back the founder and so we went we

[00:51:35] we just went with with that as a framework but

[00:51:39] I think sort of the one you know the one partial rationalization I was

[00:51:42] able to come up with for not taking the money was that I you know we

[00:51:46] looked at the history in Yahoo it there had been two

[00:51:50] other companies where they'd offered a billion dollars that had

[00:51:53] been turned down it was eBay and Google and

[00:51:57] and so I concluded that give at least

[00:52:01] you could actually make a pseudo-scientific argument

[00:52:05] that that that every case was someone had been offered a billion dollars

[00:52:09] and had rejected it it had been the correct thing to do

[00:52:12] but I do think this is a but the you know the

[00:52:16] argument that Zuckerberg finally you know finally finally

[00:52:20] came came down on was that

[00:52:24] you know there were all these new things that we were going

[00:52:28] to build at Facebook and it was clear that Yahoo

[00:52:31] wasn't valuing any of the products that had not yet been released and

[00:52:35] he wanted to have a chance to build those products and since

[00:52:39] he was pretty confident that Yahoo had and

[00:52:43] this is not anti Yahoo things I think would be true of almost all

[00:52:47] these companies that they had no definite

[00:52:51] idea about the future and therefore did not properly value things

[00:52:55] that did not yet exist they were therefore undervaluing

[00:52:59] undervaluing the business and I think this is sort of this

[00:53:03] is sort of the challenge all of us have is to

[00:53:07] to work towards the future that's not just

[00:53:10] static like a dead Channel on television but

[00:53:15] that's a that's a definite future and that is a radically

[00:53:19] better future that can that can motivate and

[00:53:22] coordinate and inspire a number of people to

[00:53:26] change the world and to go to a world where we where where

[00:53:30] luck is something for us to overcome and to

[00:53:34] deal with as we as we go along the way but but not for

[00:53:38] something that becomes this absolute dominating

[00:53:43] force that that stops all thought thought before

[00:53:46] it even starts thank you very much and

[00:53:50] I'm not going to say best of luck thank you

[00:53:58] you
