[Copy of In Tech We Trust? A Debate with Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen](https://youtu.be/VtZbWnIALeE)

[00:00:00] good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Welcome to our

[00:00:04] session um earlier this year

[00:00:07] we at The Economist newspaper published a cover story

[00:00:11] that looked at the topic of our session today Innovation

[00:00:15] and whether it is accelerating or decelerating

[00:00:19] and on the cover we had a picture of rodan's thinker

[00:00:23] always like this sitting on a lavatory

[00:00:27] and the title was will we ever invent anything this useful

[00:00:31] again it seems a little odd to be pessimistic about

[00:00:35] Innovation at a time when governments universities and

[00:00:38] firms are spending about $1.4 trillion dollar

[00:00:42] a year on research and development you know we're living in an

[00:00:45] era of smartphones and supercomputers Big Data

[00:00:49] nanotechnology gene therapy and stem cell transplants

[00:00:53] so it seems a bit odd as I said so in preparing this session I looked at quar

[00:00:57] the online question and answer site and I wanted to see if anyone had answered

[00:01:01] the question is innovation slowing and the top rated answer

[00:01:05] was from an anonymous poster who wrote I checked on Twitter YouTube and

[00:01:09] Facebook then I verified it on all 203 channels on my

[00:01:12] TV and satellite radio I double checked it via the iPhone

[00:01:16] and the answer is no now there's

[00:01:20] another side to this argument though as we noted in our editorial

[00:01:23] nobody recently has come up with an invention that's had as much impact

[00:01:27] as the laboratory with its clean lines and um its sort of intuitive

[00:01:31] user interface and although there have been advances in communication

[00:01:35] and Computing elsewhere there's been little to match the

[00:01:39] car the telephone the radio and antibiotics

[00:01:42] as well as the humble loo and they all sprang from late 19th

[00:01:46] century and 20th Century Minds so perhaps we're not

[00:01:50] living we're no longer living in an accelerating technological

[00:01:54] civilization instead of a new Sputnik we're seeing the world's

[00:01:58] Innovation engine SP to explore both

[00:02:02] sides of this fascinating issue I've got uh

[00:02:05] two most distinguished figures from Silicon Valley with me to share

[00:02:09] their perspectives uh to my left is Peter teal

[00:02:13] who's a tech investor to my right for you sorry to my left for me is

[00:02:16] a tech invest Pete steel is a tech investor a philanthropist and an

[00:02:20] entrepreneur and he's been associated with many wellknown tech

[00:02:24] companies he co-founded PayPal he was the first outside

[00:02:28] investor in uh Facebook and he's also founded

[00:02:32] co- founded a global macro fund clarium and co-founded

[00:02:36] paler Technologies which is a really interesting company that offers

[00:02:39] platforms for finance companies intelligence defense and

[00:02:43] law agencies to process uh all of the world's

[00:02:47] information to my right I have Mark Andre

[00:02:51] uh Mark's a partner and co-founder of andreon Horowitz

[00:02:55] uh he pioneered a software category that has been used

[00:02:58] by was used by more than a billion people and he's established

[00:03:02] multiple billion doll companies he co-created

[00:03:06] the highly influential Mosaic internet browser and he

[00:03:09] co-founded Netscape which sold to AOL for $4.2

[00:03:13] billion uh Andre Horowitz is a venture capital firm

[00:03:17] that provides seed Venture and grow stage funding to tech companies and

[00:03:21] has $2.7 billion under management and Mark serves

[00:03:24] on numerous boards including eBay HP and

[00:03:28] uh bump so so two very very well-qualified people

[00:03:32] to address this uh this forum and we're going to have a a quazi

[00:03:36] debate style to kick off I'm going to ask

[00:03:39] both Peter and Mark to speak for five minutes to make some opening

[00:03:43] remarks and then each of them will have a couple of minutes to

[00:03:46] respond to the others comments and then we'll have

[00:03:50] uh open discussion on stage I'll ask some questions of them both

[00:03:54] and then we'll end with a brief summary from each of them

[00:03:58] so Peter would you like to kick us off yes uh well Mark and I have

[00:04:01] been good friends for for many years and I think there are many things we agree on

[00:04:05] we agree that uh technology is a good thing and is

[00:04:09] going to make the world a better place um and we agree that it is the critical

[00:04:13] gating Factor towards uh taking our civilization to the next level

[00:04:16] in the years ahead but I'm going to start by disagreeing with the moderator here

[00:04:20] excellent and um I I'm not I actually wonder whether this sort of perspective

[00:04:24] that Mark and I have is actually a pretty odd perspective at this point and whether

[00:04:28] we actually live in a time when most people no longer think of Technology

[00:04:31] as a fundamentally good thing and you can basically look at all the movies that Hollywood

[00:04:36] produces and I think they almost all portray technology

[00:04:39] that's destructive dysfunctional kills people and you have your choice is the future

[00:04:43] going to be Matrix or Terminator or Avatar and why

[00:04:47] not Retreat into you know a Victorian house from the 19th century that seems like

[00:04:50] the best you can possibly do um and so um you know I'm a

[00:04:54] little bit nervous about speaking to this audience in Los Angeles and Mark I will watch your back

[00:04:58] if you watch you watch mine now I I think when you reflect

[00:05:01] on why there is so much hostility to

[00:05:05] technology in our culture and in our

[00:05:09] society um one one explanation I would suggest is that

[00:05:12] it has not quite been delivering the goods that it's been promising

[00:05:16] and uh and you know you have as much power in an Apple iPhone

[00:05:20] as you did um computer power that was available at the time of the Apollo

[00:05:24] missions but what it is being used for we can sort of debate how valuable

[00:05:28] that is and it's like uh it's being used to throw Angry Birds

[00:05:31] at uh at pigs um it is being used to throw sheep

[00:05:35] at one another is being used to uh send pictures of your cat to people

[00:05:38] halfway around the world it is being used to check in as

[00:05:42] the virtual mayor of a virtual nowhere while you're riding a subway from the 19th

[00:05:46] century and um and we may start to wonder

[00:05:50] whether um perhaps technology is not quite lived up to its promise

[00:05:54] from the past now I'm sure Mark will say

[00:05:57] that people have in the past always made fun of technology and of technological

[00:06:01] innovation and they've said that um they've underestimated when

[00:06:04] it's happened but I think um it has a very different character when people made

[00:06:08] fun of the wri brothers or the inventors of the automobile um they were making

[00:06:12] fun of it because it was strange and different and today the jokes

[00:06:15] are driven because it is small and trivial in the past the

[00:06:19] humor hid the fact that people were scared about how much

[00:06:22] technology was going to change the world today the humor hides the

[00:06:26] the scary fact that people are worried that there's going to be no change at all

[00:06:30] and that we are living in fact in time of General stagnation um

[00:06:34] and this is certainly reflected in very broad indicators uh wages

[00:06:37] have been stagnant in the US for 40 years 80% of the uh population

[00:06:41] in the US thinks the next generation will be less well off than the current

[00:06:45] generation and while I know you can't make a onetoone mapping between

[00:06:49] macroeconomic data and technological progress it is certainly odd

[00:06:53] that there's been a 40-year lag and that uh the sort of technological

[00:06:56] cornicopia we were promised doesn't seem to filter down to

[00:07:00] uh to most people in our society um one

[00:07:04] of the great challenges in this debate about how much acceleration is

[00:07:07] happening involves this question of how do you actually measure this and I think

[00:07:11] we will try to really hopefully drill down on this all-important

[00:07:15] measurement question uh my basic claim is that in every

[00:07:18] area outside of computers there has been deceleration since

[00:07:22] uh the 1970s um there's been no meaningful innovation in energy

[00:07:26] energy prices are significantly higher after inflation

[00:07:30] than they were um in 1972 we still have not recovered from the

[00:07:34] oil shocks of the 70s biotechnology we have 13d

[00:07:37] as many patents being approved by the FDA as were 20 years ago

[00:07:41] um deceleration in biotechnology clean clean

[00:07:45] tech has been an abysmal disaster Transportation uh not moving

[00:07:48] faster but moving slower more generally um you know even

[00:07:52] things as basic as food nanotechnology you have the whole range of

[00:07:56] things where uh where not that much progress has happened uh

[00:07:59] the one the one sort of big exception to this over the last

[00:08:03] 30 40 years has been the ongoing uh computer Revolution

[00:08:07] and uh and I think um it it doesn't seem

[00:08:11] to have been enough to really dramatically raise living standards in

[00:08:15] in this country but we can sort of hope and pray that perhaps this Revolution

[00:08:18] Will accelerate in the years ahead and that computers

[00:08:22] alone uh will save us all and some of us are doing more than hoping and praying and

[00:08:25] are actually working to try to try to bring this this about

[00:08:29] but I would say that um even if you um measure the

[00:08:33] health of the computer industry I think there are some things you can point to that are

[00:08:37] not as healthy as as you might say so if you look at uh you know there

[00:08:40] was a lot of progress 70s 80s 90s I think by a number

[00:08:44] of measurements uh the last decade the first decade of the 2000s

[00:08:48] saw a deceleration from the 1990s if you look at the number of people

[00:08:51] employed in Information Technology broadly in the US it went

[00:08:55] one up 100% in the 1990s up another

[00:08:59] 177% in the years since 2000 and if if you ignore the recession

[00:09:03] it's gone up about 38% since 2003 so slower

[00:09:07] absolute growth much slower percentage growth if you measure it in terms of

[00:09:10] Market capitalizations of companies um you know the mark

[00:09:14] Google and Amazon companies created in the in the late 90s

[00:09:18] are worth perhaps two to three times as much as all technology

[00:09:22] companies and US combined created since the year 2000

[00:09:26] um so again whether you look at it from the point of view of Labor or Capital

[00:09:30] there has been uh some sort of strange uh deceleration and

[00:09:33] uh and if I had to sort of project in the in the next decade ahead

[00:09:37] I think uh we have to um we have to at least be open to the possibility

[00:09:41] that uh the computer era is also um at risk of decelerating

[00:09:45] um we have a large uh computer Rust Belt which nobody

[00:09:49] likes to talk about but it is companies like Cisco Dell

[00:09:53] hulet Packard um you know oracle

[00:09:57] IBM where uh where I think the pattern will be to uh to

[00:10:01] um become Commodities no longer innovate correspondingly cut

[00:10:05] their labor force and cut their profits in the uh in the decade ahead

[00:10:09] there are many companies that are on the cuss Microsoft is probably close to the

[00:10:13] computer Rust Belt um you know one that's uh that's shockingly

[00:10:17] and probably in the computer rust Bel his Apple computer you know is an iPhone

[00:10:20] 5 where you move the phone jack from the top of

[00:10:24] the phone to the bottom of the phone really the sort of thing where we should be all screaming

[00:10:28] Hallelujah it's a miracle um

[00:10:32] now I think the uh anyway the the one one concluding

[00:10:35] thought on my end is I I want to underscore that um I

[00:10:39] I think of myself as The Optimist and Mark as the pessimist here

[00:10:43] and and it is because I think we can be doing a lot

[00:10:47] better you know we I think we can be looking at a whole range of Technologies

[00:10:51] futuristic computer Technologies artificial intelligence Quantum Computing

[00:10:55] space Technologies biotech Next Generation life Sciences

[00:10:59] we should be finding a cure for cancer for Alzheimer's um and I think

[00:11:03] it is not a fact of nature that the Slowdown has happened it's a cultural

[00:11:07] decision we've become risk averse we've been regulated to death we've become

[00:11:10] um incrementalist and we're not willing to uh really uh take the Bold

[00:11:14] steps we've talked ourselves into thinking that uh that throwing

[00:11:18] um throwing Angry Birds at pigs is the best we can do and

[00:11:22] that's and I think we can do better great thanks thank you

[00:11:25] um so we'll move from our Optimist there to to to

[00:11:29] Mark great so uh so it's a thrill to be here and it's a thrill to be debating

[00:11:33] my friend Peter on stage um those of you who have heard Peter in the past

[00:11:37] know that he's one of the smartest people in the world on on all these topics um and

[00:11:40] is also a very original thinker um typically in our discussions I find I agree

[00:11:44] with exactly 50% of what he of what he says 50.0%

[00:11:48] I'm going to try very hard today to find the 50% that I agree with

[00:11:52] uh out of what Peter is saying um uh since I

[00:11:56] I start by saying I I do agree that we could be doing a lot better there's a lot

[00:11:59] more we can do and we we'll probably talk about that uh today but I also think the

[00:12:03] current situation is not uh is not dire in fact is I am quite an optimist

[00:12:06] on the on the current situation um so let me start with uh

[00:12:10] with another thing that Peter has said in fact the uh the slogan of his Venture Capital

[00:12:14] firm uh Founders fund uh which uh those of you who have not tracked Founders

[00:12:17] fund U Founders fund has become one of the most important influential uh Venture

[00:12:21] Capital firms in Silicon Valley and is actually well known uh for being a very Innovative

[00:12:25] investor in areas like the ones Peter mentioned at the end uh a

[00:12:28] robotics Transportation space uh and so forth and so is a is is

[00:12:32] is a is a uh is a very big deal in the valley um the slogan of Founders

[00:12:36] fund uh is a sentence that kind of crystallizes I think Peter's argument uh in

[00:12:39] a nutshell which is we wanted flying cars uh instead we got

[00:12:43] 140 characters um I can't resist

[00:12:47] I would like to take on both sides of of uh both sides of the slogan

[00:12:51] uh so I'd like to start with flying cars um so flying cars

[00:12:55] are kind of Representative right of the technological future that was promised to us in sort of

[00:12:58] mid 20th century science fiction and if you like me like Peter you grew up uh

[00:13:02] reading this stuff it seems like everybody had a flying car um

[00:13:06] many of the Innovations interestingly of Science Fiction in the mid 20th century

[00:13:09] actually have come true satellites uh which Arthur Clark famously forecasted

[00:13:14] um the uh the the Palm Communicator that Captain Kirk used to carry uh we

[00:13:17] now have actually if you rewatch Star Trek episodes now from the 60s they're all carrying around tablets

[00:13:22] uh and and actually people didn't pay as much attention to that because everybody wanted the communicator but if you go

[00:13:25] back they literally all have iPads uh in 19 in 196

[00:13:30] um and even have little SD cards they they put in them uh

[00:13:33] we have those even even you know very futuristic Technologies laser surgery

[00:13:37] as an example uh which was a staple of Science Fiction uh have come true

[00:13:40] um other Innovations uh in addition to the flying car of course have not come true

[00:13:44] my favorite example is the meal as a pill um at

[00:13:48] this point we were all supposed to be taking our meals as pills right it would save a tremendous amount

[00:13:51] of time beef string off right as a pill um

[00:13:55] I think given the state of our civilization I think that's probably a good thing that we don't have that that

[00:13:59] um because we would have figured out how to put 8,000 calories in a pill

[00:14:02] um and we we would all be even 300 lb heavier uh than we are so

[00:14:06] I think that one worked out okay um on the flying car itself

[00:14:10] flying car is is a very interesting case cuz on the surface it seems like it must be a good

[00:14:13] idea um I find myself though agreeing with Bill Gates which is a very

[00:14:17] uncommon thing for me um which uh his comment

[00:14:20] uh when he was asked about Peter's uh statement on the flying car he said did

[00:14:24] Peter really want flying cars flying cars are not a very efficient way to move things

[00:14:28] from one point to another um in fact if you were going to have flying cars they

[00:14:31] would be incredibly inefficient uh from a power standpoint um and of

[00:14:35] course they would be far more dangerous um anybody who's been to a DMV uh

[00:14:38] in the recent past just imagine the DMV issuing licenses uh for flying car

[00:14:42] Pilots I don't know about you I would build the thickest roof I could come up with and

[00:14:46] never go

[00:14:50] outside however even beyond that uh even beyond that even just cars

[00:14:54] even Transportation Peter we we'll talk a fair amount I think about Transportation today

[00:14:57] uh Peter basically says we stalled out in transportation CU we're not going faster

[00:15:01] uh than we did in 1960 in fact in general we're going slower um I actually think the flying

[00:15:05] car and the idea that transportation is stalled out I I think it's not quite right I think that there are

[00:15:09] very significant changes happening in transportation right now um and there's actually

[00:15:12] three categories of those changes that I hope we'll get a chance to talk about today I think there's actually very fundamental

[00:15:16] uh Innovation and transportation happening um including advances in information

[00:15:20] technology that make Transportation less necessary Right video conferencing replacing

[00:15:24] trips asking any business person is a wonderful thing um and uh you

[00:15:27] know even within families ability for grandkids and grandparents to be able to communicate without

[00:15:31] having to drive 6 hours through the Midwest like I had to do when I was

[00:15:34] a kid uh I can guarantee you I consider that in advance

[00:15:38] um that brings me to uh part two of the flying cars

[00:15:42] versus 140 characters which is the 140 characters uh

[00:15:46] 140 characters of course is a reference to Twitter um uh

[00:15:49] Twitter of course makes an easy target because a lot of Twitter is in fact about what your cat

[00:15:53] had for breakfast and lunch and dinner

[00:15:56] and snacks in between um

[00:16:00] but I think that that trivializes I think actually the state think actually the

[00:16:04] theory of 140 characters is the best we would able to do actually trivializes what's happened in

[00:16:07] technology and I think also actually trivializes Twitter and so I will rise to Twitter's

[00:16:11] defense um Twitter if you think of you just step back on a minute

[00:16:15] step back for a minut to think about Twitter Twitter is instant Global public

[00:16:18] messaging for free right instant Global public messaging

[00:16:22] for free if you think about the impact of that if you go back into any previous era

[00:16:26] right the era of telegraph the era of telephone the era of Vision

[00:16:29] um you know all Martin's predecessors at the at the economist going back 150 years if

[00:16:33] you go back to any previous era and you tell them instead of having the communication

[00:16:37] Technologies you had at the time I can give you instant Global public

[00:16:40] messaging for free they would have thought that you had delivered it straight from heaven like it's it's the most

[00:16:44] astonishing Communications breakthrough they could have possibly imagined and we actually have

[00:16:47] it and it actually works um and it's growing at an astonishing pace and I think everybody's

[00:16:51] going to be on it and I think it's a really big deal I think it's a really big deal for business

[00:16:55] um I think it's a really big deal for news I think every reporter in the room would agree with with that

[00:16:59] um I think it's a very big deal for politics um and then I think it's also actually a

[00:17:03] very big deal for cultural Discovery um which is

[00:17:06] new online media like Twitter and Facebook make it easier for people to meet people who are

[00:17:10] not like themselves and make it easier for people to meet people from other countries and other cultures

[00:17:14] uh and interact with them and a lot a lot of the experience of kids today uh is interacting

[00:17:18] with people from other countries from A very early age in a way that that at least my generation never

[00:17:21] did um so I think it's a very very big deal across all those Dimensions

[00:17:25] um more generally um I I would certainly assert you know that

[00:17:29] no surprise probably to Peter and anybody i' assert the central role that information technology

[00:17:33] is going to play uh in our in our in our civil civilization advancing

[00:17:36] in particular communication technology um like Twitter communication technology

[00:17:40] is often disregarded or trivialized as you know people talk to each other about all kinds of nonsense

[00:17:44] why does it matter the whole basis of our civilization in my view

[00:17:48] is communication right without communication we would all be sitting in caves by ourselves

[00:17:52] right unable to do things unable to learn about things unable to form into groups

[00:17:56] um and the ability for people to be able to communicate and being able to have communication

[00:18:00] costs come down the curve uh as aggressively as they are I think is a

[00:18:03] very very big potential setup and platform uh for what happens

[00:18:07] over the next 20 30 years um and in particular I think communication will be

[00:18:10] the Catalyst for a lot of Innovations in a lot of other Industries I think communication is the platform

[00:18:14] on top of which a lot of other innovation's Happening by letting innovators

[00:18:18] communicate with each other letting innovators collaborate letting innovators team and combine

[00:18:22] uh expertise and information uh much more fluidly than they used to be able to

[00:18:25] uh to do that um let me and with a comment on

[00:18:29] perspective um Peter address this briefly

[00:18:33] um in history if you read history the great Innovations of the past are

[00:18:37] now well understood as being very very important it's very obvious it's very obvious

[00:18:41] uh the Innovations of the past that turn out to be very important um in almost every

[00:18:44] case they were not widely understood as such at the time um in fact I

[00:18:48] would I would assert that they were often actually viewed as trivialities or jokes I don't think

[00:18:51] that this is a new phenomenon uh to be this dismissive about new technologies

[00:18:55] early let me give three quick examples um the telephone

[00:18:59] when uh when Thomas Edison first in Thomas Edison was first working

[00:19:03] on the telephone um the Assumption of the use case motivating

[00:19:07] his early work on the telephone um was the idea that Telegraph

[00:19:10] operators needed to be able to talk to each other right it was considered

[00:19:14] so implausible that you would have a system that would let any ordinary person

[00:19:18] pick up the telephone and talk to another ordinary person like that was clearly implausible that was clearly

[00:19:21] not going to happen but you had all these Telegraph operators all scattered throughout the world

[00:19:25] and you had all these coordination problems between Telegraph operators as sent messages to

[00:19:28] each other and they said boy if we could actually let the telegraph operators talk to each other that would make the

[00:19:32] telegraph work a lot better right completely missing uh the larger

[00:19:36] opportunity um the internet um I have personal experience with this one

[00:19:40] the Internet it's hard to remember the internet was laughed at was laughed at

[00:19:43] it was heaped with scorn from 199 1993 basically to

[00:19:47] 1997 1998 um in fact those of you who were in the industry

[00:19:51] at that time will remember the New York Times had a reporter on staff named Peter Lewis hopefully

[00:19:55] he's here in the room um uh I'm convinced

[00:19:59] he was specifically hired by the editors to just write negative stories about the internet

[00:20:02] it was like all he did and it was always the internet was never going to be a consumer medium the internet is

[00:20:06] not nearly as big as these people think nobody is ever going to trust the internet for Ecommerce it

[00:20:09] was literally like every week there was a negative story uh in the times about the internet which

[00:20:13] you know causes me a certain amount of pleasure today um uh watching The New

[00:20:17] York Times company try to cope with the consequences of the technology that they laughed

[00:20:22] at I try not to indulge in shot and Frey every once in a while it sneaks through

[00:20:27] um finally my my final example the car so the

[00:20:30] car was absolutely viewed as a triviality in the toy when it first emerged

[00:20:34] in fact JP Morgan himself refused to invest in Ford Motor Company

[00:20:38] uh with the response that's just a toy for rich people which is in fact what it was at the time

[00:20:41] if you had one of the first cars you actually you had it to be a rich person which meant you also had to

[00:20:45] have a you had to have a driver um unless you were a very very uh

[00:20:49] Advanced rich person um you often actually had to also have a stoker with your early

[00:20:52] cars to keep the engine going um and then you also had to travel with a full-time mechanic

[00:20:56] uh cuz the thing would break down every 3 month miles so there were a lot of reasons to doubt the importance

[00:21:00] of the car um my favorite example of skepticism about the car

[00:21:04] um and in fact cultural rejection of the car um there were a series of laws

[00:21:08] passed in the late 1800s in the UK and also in the US called the Red Flag

[00:21:11] laws at the time so the UK red flag law uh worked as

[00:21:15] follows um with respect to to cars firstly

[00:21:19] um at least three persons shall be employed to drive or conduct any automobile

[00:21:23] um which is actually not that crazy because it was already assumed that you had your driver and your mechanic

[00:21:27] uh with you um secondly one of such persons while any automobile

[00:21:30] is in motion shall preced such Auto automobile on foot by not

[00:21:34] less than 60 yards and shall carry a red flag

[00:21:38] constantly displayed and shall warn the Riders and drivers of horses of the

[00:21:42] approach of such Automobiles and shall signal the driver thereof when it shall be

[00:21:45] necessary to stop so possibly a little bit of protectionism on

[00:21:49] on the part of the blacksmith Guild um but still a a

[00:21:52] good sign of the times in terms of just the initial shock and and initial rejection of the idea

[00:21:57] it turns out that's not even the really entertaining one um the really entertaining one was

[00:22:00] Pennsylvania in 1896 uh legislators unanimously

[00:22:04] passed a bill through both houses of the state legislature uh which would require

[00:22:07] all motorists piloting their Horseless carriages upon chance encounters

[00:22:11] with riders on Horseback or cattle to number one immediately stop the vehicle

[00:22:15] number two immediately I have to give Pas a little bit of a chance to get back at you I'm

[00:22:19] almost done I'm almost done I'm almost done okay immediately stop the vehicle immediately

[00:22:23] and as rapidly as possible disassemble the

[00:22:26] automobile number three conceal the various components out of sight behind nearby

[00:22:31] bushes until equestrian livestock is sufficiently pacified

[00:22:35] um so the point is the great Innovations of the present I believe are virtually guaranteed

[00:22:38] to be viewed as trivial and to be viewed as jokes um I think history 50

[00:22:42] hundred years from now will enshroud them in Legend uh in our time they won't be recognized as

[00:22:45] such of course in the future when they become Legends the our our

[00:22:49] descendants will themselves have their own trivial Innovations to laugh at great

[00:22:53] thank you um Peter I'll give you some some time now to to

[00:22:57] respond to that something a extended five minutes yes uh well let's

[00:23:00] see I think I think um you know I do think the question

[00:23:04] of uh the question of how one measures all these things

[00:23:08] is very important so uh it is it is true

[00:23:11] that it's hard to measure these things at the precise moment they happen but

[00:23:15] that is of course what we're trying to figure out you know we're trying to figure out are things

[00:23:18] accelerating are they decelerating and I I suggested you know a number of different

[00:23:22] ways you could try to measure them you look at you how many people are working in the computer industry

[00:23:26] you could look at um the market capitalizations of companies

[00:23:30] you could look at uh I I do think there's something to be said for a common sense

[00:23:34] intuition on this even though um that you know obviously there ways the ways that

[00:23:37] that's gone gone wrong in one form or another but I think um the question

[00:23:41] really is how do we measure you so one of the questions I would ask for Mark

[00:23:44] to answer at some point would be what facts would convince him

[00:23:48] that we're no longer living in an accelerating civilization because you can always find

[00:23:52] some anecdotes where something's happening it may be a very big change

[00:23:56] you know the history of the 90s I think was complicated because uh even

[00:23:59] though um the internet was initially underestimated it was perhaps

[00:24:03] um in in the final stage of the 90s overestimated and so the mistakes have been made

[00:24:06] in in both directions where people um under and overestimated

[00:24:10] uh things and uh and there's sort of an important question uh what we're

[00:24:14] doing today my argument my view today is that we're probably there's not as much

[00:24:18] hype as the late 90s but there's also not as much reality if you look at the

[00:24:21] market capitalizations the companies created in the last decade let

[00:24:25] me say one note on transportation and uh and Twitter

[00:24:29] um I always like to start with a transportation example because at these sorts

[00:24:33] of conferences people have traveled and they've sort of had firstand experience

[00:24:36] with the uh great um lowtech airport security

[00:24:40] um that sort of has taken Transportation speeds back to 1960 or into State

[00:24:44] 405 and Angelino here will know um and which which is

[00:24:47] working less well than did in 1950 or 1960 or or things

[00:24:51] like that and while it's it's possible that we're

[00:24:54] just on the cusp of some dramatic Improv Movement we have

[00:24:58] to differentiate the past from the future and so um

[00:25:02] my argument is you know 1750 to 1970

[00:25:05] accelerating technological change 1970 to 2010

[00:25:09] deceleration maybe it will start re accelerating but uh

[00:25:13] but one should be a little lot more skeptical about things that are just on the cusp

[00:25:17] of happening versus things that have already happened you know we were promised

[00:25:21] in 1970 that we were on the cusp of curing cancer you know was Nixon

[00:25:24] declared war on cancer would be solved by the bicentennial 1976

[00:25:28] 43 years later you know obviously we're 43 years closer to a cure

[00:25:33] but we would tend to think that given how long the journey has been it's

[00:25:36] maybe going to take a little bit longer than people think and most people no longer think

[00:25:40] it will just be six years from now and so I think we have to differentiate very

[00:25:43] sharply um things you know that uh have not

[00:25:47] happened versus things that are on the cusp um you know sort of um

[00:25:51] better uh voice communication Technologies were already being talked about

[00:25:54] in the 1990s maybe they're about to happen you know hard to hard to

[00:25:58] say um certainly flying cars are are not realistic

[00:26:02] listening to uh listening however to what Mark described as the regulations on the

[00:26:06] car industry in the 1900 they were much nicer then than they

[00:26:09] would be to flying cars today and he didn't even mention sequestration where all the

[00:26:13] FAA control has disappear yes so flying cars would they would not even get off the

[00:26:16] ground today no bad bad pun but uh but I think

[00:26:20] um but I think the flying car issue and the transportation issue

[00:26:24] um is really a link to a fundamental lack of in in

[00:26:28] energy if I had to sort of say what sector is the one that really matters

[00:26:32] it's energy when when I've looked at this over over time you

[00:26:35] look at the amount of energy input into an economy is

[00:26:39] very close proxy for GDP growth uh and we've had

[00:26:43] a lot of progress in computers and we've had a lot of resource depletion energy

[00:26:46] over the last 40 years and that's I think uh why we've had the sort of sheer force

[00:26:50] on the American economy where it's like the uh red Queen's race in Allison

[00:26:54] Wonderland where you're running faster and faster and you end up staying in just the exact

[00:26:57] same place um and so I think the uh the main reason we don't have

[00:27:01] flying cars is they would take up too much oil um it's the main reason

[00:27:04] you don't you don't even have helicopters going from the San Francisco Airport to the Oakland

[00:27:08] Airport to San Francisco which you did have in the 1970s it was a

[00:27:12] nice fast uh service it got stopped after 1973 with the

[00:27:15] oil shock has never been reintroduced uh and so I think uh there

[00:27:19] are sort of a lot of uh ways in which uh these Technologies point

[00:27:22] to things that do not happen now the the my general critique of

[00:27:26] Twitter is not of Twitter as a company I should make that clear I think it

[00:27:29] is a perfectly fine company it's valued at about 10 billion dollars

[00:27:33] I think that's a that's probably a reasonable valuation they have a thousand

[00:27:37] people working there I think those thousand people have great job

[00:27:41] security for the next decade um maybe better than some investment

[00:27:44] think but they have great job security for the next decade and uh

[00:27:49] and it uh and um and perhaps a lot more than people working at the New

[00:27:52] York Times will or something like that sort of a as a as a Counterpoint

[00:27:56] um but the uh but the but the question out of that was Peter

[00:28:00] I got got get it from both sides but the uh but the question

[00:28:04] U still is um it is a specific success as a company

[00:28:07] but is this really the kind of change that will dramatically

[00:28:11] improve our economy will dra dramatically improve living standards

[00:28:14] and how do we measure it and uh if you measure it in terms of GDP

[00:28:19] per capita incomes all these sorts of things um it doesn't

[00:28:22] really seem to translate you know the 1930s we had

[00:28:26] a financial econom IC crisis as well um and

[00:28:30] in the 1930s California was the center of technology

[00:28:33] and it was the best state in the US Steinbeck Grapes

[00:28:37] of Wrath people moved from Oklahoma to California you had the aviation

[00:28:40] industry the movie industry all sorts of industries that got off the ground

[00:28:44] in California um California still is the center of innovation

[00:28:48] the finance crisis was centered on the East Coast um if you

[00:28:51] if you just take those two facts you'd say California would be still the best states

[00:28:55] in the US I think the demographics probably would suggest that people on

[00:28:59] net are moving from California to Oklahoma which again suggests

[00:29:02] something about the magnitudes of how big is the tech industry is it enough

[00:29:06] to save all of Western Civilization enough to save the United States

[00:29:10] enough to save the state of California I think it's about enough to bail

[00:29:13] out the government workers unions in the city of San Francisco

[00:29:17] okay on that point I'd like to hand back to Mark do you want to respond to some of

[00:29:21] that then I have some questions that I'm dying to get in um but

[00:29:24] I I'd love to give you some chance to respond there so I think by now you probably

[00:29:28] we each have a response for everything so I will I will I will I'll try I'll try to narrow

[00:29:32] M down a little a little a little bit more so I'd actually like to dive straight into energy and transportation

[00:29:36] we could spend the entire SE session defending information technology I think people will draw

[00:29:40] whatever conclusions said there but let's dive into energy and transportation so let's

[00:29:43] start with energy so my assertion is we have tremendous innovation in energy uh

[00:29:47] and it's stalled out by government intervention so we have had actually in the last 10 years

[00:29:50] massive technical Innovation across almost every dimension of of emerging Energy

[00:29:54] Technologies solar the price of Solar has dropped like a rock uh

[00:29:57] wind geothermal biofuels fuel cells energy storage energy transmission

[00:30:01] um on and on and on I think the in my view the real my analysis of energy is

[00:30:05] the problem with oil and gas is not that it's too expensive it's that it's too cheap

[00:30:09] um we live in a world that has had unbelievably large subsidies for oil and

[00:30:12] gas for many decades uh direct subsidies to fossil fuels

[00:30:16] uh per year running about $500 billion worldwide right now uh indirect

[00:30:20] subsidies are much larger including most of United States foreign policy in the Middle East

[00:30:24] X is real most of United States foreign policy of $3 trillion wars

[00:30:28] in the last 10 years and the only reason ex Israel for us to be there and

[00:30:31] to worry about these countries is because of oil um and so

[00:30:35] if I'm an Entre I'm not but if I'm an entrepreneur in clean tech and I'm working on getting my $200

[00:30:39] million in government subsidies uh to try to get my technology uh to be cost

[00:30:43] competitive against oil and gas and I look at the trillions of dollars in subsidies of

[00:30:46] the of the existing technology I mean it's basically a hopeless proposition

[00:30:50] the technology has however continued to advance generally what's happened with clean

[00:30:54] tech is that the clean tech Alternatives get to Within about 2x

[00:30:58] uh of the price performance that they would need to be at in order to start replacing oil and gas

[00:31:02] and then they stall out because of the subsidy imbalance um and and people

[00:31:06] say aha it didn't work um but those new technologies have not

[00:31:09] yet had the opportunity to come down the price performance curve the Technologies come down

[00:31:13] as they get cheaper as they expand into volume because they they don't make it to volume solar

[00:31:16] actually being the exception solar has not gotten into volume and so the price is coming down very fast

[00:31:20] um and so these things stall out people say aha it didn't work aha the subsidies don't work and they ignore

[00:31:24] the subsidies on the other side of the Ledger they ignore ignore the massive warp

[00:31:28] uh of government supporting oil and gas um so my assertion is we

[00:31:32] can have massive energy Innovation maybe this makes me the pessimist actually we can

[00:31:36] have massive energy innovation in our economy anytime we want

[00:31:39] uh what we have to do is stop sub subsidizing oil and gas um now

[00:31:43] whether that will happen in our lifetimes I don't have the slightest idea I do know it is a 100%

[00:31:46] a political problem it's not a technology problem let me jump trans

[00:31:50] yeah let me jump real quick to Transportation so here are the three fundamental areas

[00:31:54] of advances in transportation that I'm that I'm that I'm paying a lot of attention to so one is

[00:31:58] Vehicles themselves and we we'll probably argue a lot about this but um electric cars

[00:32:01] have made significant advances in the last 10 years uh including Tesla which is

[00:32:05] an investment of Peters you know absolutely phenomenal company um again

[00:32:09] at very very very low unit volumes right and so they have not had the

[00:32:12] chance yet to come down the price performance curves we don't know how good the economics

[00:32:16] are going to get when they start selling at the same rate the conventional cars are which may

[00:32:20] by the way never happen if oil and gas keeps getting subsidized which is why these concepts

[00:32:23] are so connected that's one two self-driving cars are very close

[00:32:27] um Google basically has them working uh Mercedes actually almost has them

[00:32:30] working Mercedes their new topof the line sedan coming up this summer they

[00:32:34] had almost they had a very large amount of self-driving technology in it they yanked it at the last minute

[00:32:38] because they didn't think that was we didn't think laws at the state level are ready yet to handle

[00:32:42] uh self-driving cars um but they're actually very very close so we'll talk

[00:32:45] more about that um two is optimization and I think this is

[00:32:49] important um there are new technologies

[00:32:53] actually interestingly generally smartphone based um around optimizing traffic

[00:32:57] um and so the app that you might actually use today uh is called waves spelled

[00:33:01] w and it's a mapping app that gives you realtime traffic peer-to-peer

[00:33:04] networking of traffic it's like almost like bit torn a traffic or um Napster

[00:33:08] of traffic uh where people driving around the road are uploading all their traffic

[00:33:11] data including all the location data off their smartphone and pooling it so that you know what's

[00:33:15] happening with traffic and routes right now um and you so if you use ways you can

[00:33:19] find yourself rebalancing your route in real time against all the other drivers on ways

[00:33:23] which are starting to be in some areas of the country large enough percentage of drivers were starting

[00:33:26] to an impact on traffic flows um we have the opportunity to have

[00:33:30] everybody in the country using systems like this and then optimize traffic loads across all

[00:33:33] the roads and bridges um there's actually a whole academic field called societal

[00:33:37] networking uh Stanford's very strong in this which is around the incentives to

[00:33:41] do exactly this and there's a I think there's a lot of reasons for optimism there the point of that

[00:33:44] is if we get that right it really reduces the requirement to build new roads and

[00:33:48] bridges right because we can balance the traffic we can balance the time we've never

[00:33:51] had the technology to be able to do that before because we've never had Wireless communication and computers

[00:33:55] and all the cars um and now we do cars themselves are

[00:33:59] being optimized we have the rise of the collaborative consumption movement and we have these services

[00:34:02] like sidecar and Lyft and Uber um that basically make it possible to share cars

[00:34:06] and so we can reduce the need for cars we can reduce the number of cars on the road and then finally

[00:34:10] Replacements I indicated right anybody who traveled to this conference had a bad travel experience

[00:34:14] anybody who stays home gets to watch this conference on video later on they have a fantastic

[00:34:18] travel experience they don't need to leave their living room the substitution of fensive Transportation

[00:34:22] I think are going to be a very big deal in the years to come uh high quality

[00:34:25] telepresence is only becoming a reality um and we are very those

[00:34:29] of you who have seen like highend Cisco telepresence Systems it's like being in the same room with people

[00:34:33] and that stuff is going to commoditize very quickly very interesting Peter Mark

[00:34:37] picks up sort of two common themes that I often hear when when when I'm

[00:34:40] reporting on Innovation you one is that well it's all the government's

[00:34:44] fault so your energy question you know yeah it there hasn't been Innovation

[00:34:48] but Mark's Point well yeah but it's because the government's in the way number one

[00:34:52] the second argument is yes text coming to the rescue don't worry

[00:34:56] it might look bad but within about three or four five years there's technology

[00:34:59] coming and you know you've got Ray curtz you've got George Gilder saying you know sooner

[00:35:03] or later bioinformatics every it's going to solve the Peter teal

[00:35:07] concerns he doesn't need to be worried because it is coming to the rescue

[00:35:11] that's Mark's point on Transportation what do you make of both of well well certainly a number

[00:35:14] of these people have been saying these things for a while so there's some question at what point

[00:35:18] uh at what point does one become a little bit more skeptical of what

[00:35:21] uh what people what people have said I I would say um

[00:35:25] I'm I I'm actually very sympathetic to Mark's point that there's a big government regulatory

[00:35:30] problem and we live in a world where the world of stuff has been regulated

[00:35:34] and the world of bits has not been regulated um and uh

[00:35:38] and so um if you were an engineer when I went to Stanford in the mid

[00:35:41] 80s engineering was a terrible field to go into almost all areas of engineering

[00:35:45] were bad chemical engineering bio bio biochemical engineering

[00:35:49] uh electrical engineering not say nothing of nuclear engineering mechanical

[00:35:53] engineering industrial engineering Aero Aster engineering

[00:35:57] terrible terrible career decisions I mean we've been punishing engineers in this country for 40 years

[00:36:00] people are not allowed to build things you know um and you can see it with

[00:36:04] things like you know the Empire State building was built in 15 months in 1931

[00:36:08] 32 it's taken 12 years in counting to to rebuild the World Trade Center

[00:36:12] Golden Gate Bridge in my backyard was built in three and a half years in the 30s it's

[00:36:16] taking seven years to build an access road that's costing more than the original bridge

[00:36:19] in real dollars so um so we we have it's been a bad decision

[00:36:23] to become an engineer computer science and financial engineer in have been

[00:36:27] the two exceptions to this I think Financial engineering not so much going

[00:36:30] forward so it's sort of been reduced to um this one very narrow

[00:36:34] area and everything else has been outlawed but that's you know

[00:36:38] that's a perfectly reasonable explanation why there's been tremendous deceleration

[00:36:41] then the question becomes is our computers alone

[00:36:45] enough to save us and uh and it's

[00:36:49] very hard for them to break out of this virtual world when the real world

[00:36:52] remains massively regulated and uh and you know I I think it's

[00:36:57] very interesting question what will happen with the self-driving cars you know

[00:37:00] will will will you be able to have them who's liable will the

[00:37:04] will the uh company doing the computer code be liable if the car crashes

[00:37:08] um and and all these sorts of questions will be tremendous Hang-Ups

[00:37:12] in a super risk averse society that we live in what about Mark's other point which is

[00:37:16] very interesting he made it right at the end so we sort of lost it but this point about time

[00:37:19] lag you know if you look back I mean the Industrial Revolution the gains from

[00:37:23] that in wages and living standards it was almost like a century before

[00:37:26] they started showing up in British workers um pay packets

[00:37:30] you've got you know a a sort of classic lag about 5 to

[00:37:34] 15 years before Communications Technologies and it Technologies tend

[00:37:37] to show through in Pay packets and wages so that's one

[00:37:41] possibility Mark might be right you know that there's just this lag and we're not seeing it

[00:37:45] and there's a second possibility which is the uh you know the argument that's put forward

[00:37:49] by um Eric Bolson who says well actually what you're seeing is

[00:37:53] massive advances in technology and actually what they're doing is displacing labor

[00:37:57] so laborers you robots are coming next year I won't be chairing

[00:38:00] this there'll be a robot here C3PO with my accent and it'll be terrible

[00:38:04] but nevertheless you know we are as the New York Times and the economists are all doomed

[00:38:08] to die I thought i' bring that but nevertheless you maybe there's two things

[00:38:11] going on here one there's a lag and two actually what we're seeing is this displacement

[00:38:15] of Labor with with technology or maybe there's not that much technology happening

[00:38:19] so that's the third possibility now I think the uh the lag the question

[00:38:22] is how long is the lag at this point we're going on 40 years

[00:38:26] have been you know um mean wages have been stagnant not

[00:38:30] median it's not an income inequality issue so um mean wages

[00:38:34] went up 350% in the US after inflation from 1933 to

[00:38:38] 1973 went up 22% from 73 to 2013

[00:38:42] um median wages were flat so it's become more unequal but even

[00:38:46] even if you had redistributed everything it's gone up only 22%

[00:38:50] right and that I think Al now on the second point in fact there is no robot

[00:38:53] sitting there I will at least I think I think there's robot sitting there

[00:38:57] and uh and uh and you know it's that is a distributional

[00:39:01] question so it's uh it's true that if um if computers replace

[00:39:05] labor it might lead to more unequal Society I'm not I'm not sure that's true

[00:39:09] but uh but then you you presumably create enough more wealth that you could figure out some

[00:39:13] ways to redistribute it but uh but the problem is there is

[00:39:16] actually not that much wealth around to redistribute if you confiscated

[00:39:20] all the money from every billionaire in the United States you'd basically

[00:39:24] pay off the government deficit for one year right and so

[00:39:27] um it's it's not that there's been Technologies led to this incredibly unequal

[00:39:31] wealth if you look at if you look at um I was looking

[00:39:34] at this the other day the Forbes list 92 people who are worth 10 billion

[00:39:38] or more on the Forbes list from 2012 where did they make money

[00:39:42] 11 of them made it in technology all 11 were in

[00:39:45] computers um and that's the narrative that you like to tell

[00:39:49] but there were 25 and we've heard of all of them okay you've heard of all the names

[00:39:53] you know it's it's Bill Gates it's um

[00:39:57] Larry Ellison Jeff Bezos on and on um

[00:40:00] Mark Zuckerberg on and on there are 25 people who

[00:40:04] made it in mining natural resources which are basically

[00:40:07] cases of technological failure because Commodities are inelastic goods

[00:40:11] and people make a fortune when there's a famine if you're a farmer

[00:40:15] because um people pay way more for food if there's a little bit if there's not enough

[00:40:19] and so 25 people in the last 40 years have made their fortunes because of a lack

[00:40:23] of innovation 11 people have made them because of Innovation

[00:40:26] and we never talk about those 25 people I could go down the list you would not have

[00:40:30] heard about half of them in this audience and so there's this incredible media

[00:40:34] skew where we're celebrating the technology people and then we can

[00:40:37] have a secondary debate how do we take their money and give it to other people um

[00:40:41] and um and we never talk about the uh the the

[00:40:45] uh the incredible uh Trend towards um towards

[00:40:48] inequality driven by a shortage of in Innovation which is what you see

[00:40:52] in the fortunes that have made in oil natural gas things of that sort in the last

[00:40:56] four just come back to mark on on energy you know you say government gets in

[00:40:59] the way when I look at the the electrical grid so let's not talk

[00:41:03] about generating the electricity but Distributing it I mean if I were Edison I came up today

[00:41:06] I'd probably say well it looks pretty familiar to me I mean the last 50 years

[00:41:10] there been virtually no change and if you look at the the sort of R&D

[00:41:14] spend of energy companies me managing grids it's like

[00:41:18] 0.17% of sales you know if you look at a pharmaceutical company

[00:41:21] way higher so you is there just not a fundamental problem

[00:41:25] in terms of the grid itself as opposed to all the stuff that's going into it well when you

[00:41:29] get government sponsored monopolies that's what you get I mean that that that that is the consequence

[00:41:32] I mean in energy Innovation itself there are astonishing things happening there's um

[00:41:36] uh there are people working on wireless uh energy Transmission in the house um so to be able to

[00:41:40] just have everything in the house powered wirelessly so no more wires there are people working on Long

[00:41:44] Haul uh energy transmission there' actually been significant advances in nuclear

[00:41:47] power right France gets 80% of their electricity from nuclear you know if

[00:41:51] you if you put there's there's advances Peter actually has an investment in a company uh

[00:41:54] very very bright entrepreneur in b doing energy storage in

[00:41:58] in air ined air um which is incredibly

[00:42:02] interesting um if you put all these together right you can start to imagine a different layout

[00:42:06] you can start to imagine you know put 50 new state-of-the nuclear plants in you

[00:42:09] know have put countries up for bid like who wants the nukes um

[00:42:13] and then run um Long Haul transmission uh to all the other

[00:42:16] countries um and then do wireless transmission uh in the house like there are completely

[00:42:20] different ways to do this um but when you have in trench government monopolies in these areas

[00:42:24] this is probably pet the main area of over between Peter and me when you have entrench

[00:42:27] government protection and government monopolies government subsidies it certainly is a big inhibitor

[00:42:31] to that and then at some point people will stop innovating at some point you know like

[00:42:35] the clean tech thing has gone on for a decade but at some point people will give

[00:42:38] up and uh and I do think um I think

[00:42:42] there's a question why there's been a Slowdown that's important but um

[00:42:46] the question I think maybe it's the government's fault but

[00:42:49] I go back to the fundamental thing is we've had a Slowdown in all these areas we've not the Innovations

[00:42:53] have not been allowed to see the light of day but you know the static ICS out there from

[00:42:57] uh it was a Brooking study earlier this year that said you know American patents

[00:43:01] um you know they an all-time high patent filing had lawyers

[00:43:04] are at alltime high too yeah but if you look back in Cycles

[00:43:09] they went back to 1790 when American patents have been at a

[00:43:12] cyclical High innovation has tended to be at a high too

[00:43:16] you know you subsequently see that Innovation come through in

[00:43:19] the real economy so I agree with you there's a certain

[00:43:23] amount of of lawyer driven s here sorry to all the lawyers the audience but nevertheless

[00:43:27] you know the perhaps there are some really some things going on that Mark says

[00:43:31] that we're just not really picking up on but they're embedded in those patents

[00:43:35] there well it's look it goes back to this this measurement question

[00:43:39] it it strikes me that patents are not the best way to measure it I prefer

[00:43:42] to look at wages macroeconomic data capitalizations

[00:43:46] of companies I mean the markets do discount the future to some extent

[00:43:50] so if you look at companies tech companies started 2000 to 2013

[00:43:54] you sum all the market caps compare with tech company started in the 1990s

[00:43:58] you sum those market caps four times as much 1980s close

[00:44:02] to the '90s '70s close to the ' 80s so you look at it you'd see

[00:44:05] a very big drop off in the last 13 years um I

[00:44:09] don't I'm not all these measures are imperfect I'm not saying that's the Holy Grail

[00:44:13] but uh but I think uh there are sort of a number of these different ways you can

[00:44:17] you can triangulate uh I I I do think um

[00:44:20] I do think one can make both mistakes you can make the mistake of being

[00:44:25] too uh iCal of things that are incipient and not

[00:44:29] giving them a chance to sort of breathe and develop but you can also make the

[00:44:32] CH mistake of being too gullible and if you think that you have this cornucopian

[00:44:37] future that the future will take care of itself um you end

[00:44:40] up with a country like the US where you have a savings rate of minus 6% if you include

[00:44:44] government deficit spending um people think the future will take care of

[00:44:47] itself you end up with um one bubble after another

[00:44:51] where people have been promised that the future will be fantastic and we've

[00:44:54] had a quarter century of one bubble after another in this country

[00:44:58] Tech Housing Finance I think now probably government bubble

[00:45:02] um and um and they keep blowing up because you

[00:45:06] know um you end up with a credit crisis when the president does not live

[00:45:09] up to the Fantastic expectations the past

[00:45:13] had about the future and so there is something very off with our

[00:45:16] calibration the D one one one anecdotal data point from 1967

[00:45:21] um it was a book uh fantastic book written called the American challenge

[00:45:25] by uh J J zon shriber it was how the US lived in an accelerating

[00:45:29] technological civilization and what would this look like and he predicted a lot

[00:45:32] of the computers Innovation Automation and by the year 2000

[00:45:36] because the US was accelerating it would mean that it would leave the

[00:45:40] rest of the World Behind and therefore people have to compete less with other

[00:45:44] countries and therefore the average American worker in the year 2000

[00:45:48] would be working 7 hours a day 4 days a week

[00:45:52] with 13 weeks a year of paid vacation time um and

[00:45:56] even though we'd like to dismiss him because he's French um

[00:45:59] um we do have to you have to acknowledge that from 1850

[00:46:03] to 1970 work hours steadily went down

[00:46:06] and that's what happens in an accelerating civilation people have to work less hard and we're not talking

[00:46:10] about the creative people or the CEOs who love their jobs we're talking about the average

[00:46:14] people who actually would like to have a work life balance

[00:46:17] you asked an interesting question on I want to ask both of you that that question

[00:46:21] and start with Mark what evidence would you need to convince

[00:46:25] you your position is wrong yeah there's

[00:46:29] um there's three uh two that are in numbers uh and one

[00:46:32] that is uh an intangible um so uh

[00:46:36] on the number side it's it's also actually the same answer to the question of of of of how do I measure Innovation

[00:46:40] so um at the macro level I I I think there's an input metric and

[00:46:43] output metric both of which are relevant the input metric number of scientists and engineers in

[00:46:47] the world I mean sort of the raw material of innovation are the people who innovate um

[00:46:50] I think probably in the long run that's a good proxy I'll come back to the what might

[00:46:54] be the problem with that at the end but that that's probably a good proxy all the things being equal

[00:46:58] um the facts there are actually quite astonishing uh 2.1 million uh

[00:47:02] natural science and engineering degrees granted in the year 2000 worldwide

[00:47:05] Grew From 2.1 to 3.7 Million by 2008 you know an enormous

[00:47:09] takeoff of Science and Math and engineering education and the developing World um

[00:47:13] the number of researchers increased from 3.9 million in 1995 worldwide

[00:47:16] to 5.7 million in 2007 it's so huge uh increase the number of researchers

[00:47:20] um so um I so answer to the question of what would convince me

[00:47:24] I'm wrong if those numbers start to fall in a dramatic way that would for sure

[00:47:28] have a big impact on my thinking um on the output side median

[00:47:31] mean wages I they they they intermix inequality as a factor

[00:47:35] I I would prefer to look at per capita GDP um just look at the straight number

[00:47:38] of per capita GDP and then if we want to work backwards into the inequality issue we we

[00:47:42] can do that which is a very interesting issue uh but per capita GDP

[00:47:46] um over as we all know over the long sweep of time per capita GDP

[00:47:49] actually follows a mors law exponential if you look at us per capita

[00:47:53] GDP it's almost exactly the same curve you see on Advan in

[00:47:57] semiconductor technology it's a straight exponential curve uh over

[00:48:00] a very long period of time 150 years since 1871 per

[00:48:04] capita GDP in in this country has gone from $300 to

[00:48:08] $445,000 uh in current dollars the other interesting thing about looking at

[00:48:11] this curve is you see these crises like the Great Depression and you see you know the

[00:48:15] the the com bust and there these tiny little squiggles on what otherwise

[00:48:19] is this is this unbelievable curve um and so if we saw a sustained

[00:48:23] drop in per capita GDP I mean that would put me into a complete Panic

[00:48:27] um the final thing that I would look at is is is um

[00:48:31] the imagination component if we fundamentally lose our imagination right the the

[00:48:34] the the obvious critique of number of Engineers and scientists in the world is well what what are they

[00:48:38] all going to work on and what if there aren't enough new ideas what if they can't come up with enough new ideas

[00:48:42] um and if we fundamentally stall out when it comes to imagination and creativity um

[00:48:46] that would be meas be real concern the problem with that one is it's an intangible

[00:48:50] yeah um you can maybe measure it you know some a loose metric might be the number of scientific

[00:48:53] papers or something like that um but uh it's it's it's a loose

[00:48:57] one patents by the way I think at this point have become an anti- indicator

[00:49:01] uh Peter I think might even agree with this patents have become an the patent system

[00:49:04] actually it's interesting the patent system all the people in our world believe that the

[00:49:08] patent system is fundamentally broken um like fundamentally broken in that

[00:49:11] it has become you can almost prank the patent uh you can

[00:49:15] basically at this point if you wanted to you could file fake patents and get them granted all day long

[00:49:19] I mean the the patent examiners have basically as far as we can tell have completely lost the ability

[00:49:22] to actually differentiate between an innovation and just another copycat

[00:49:26] uh feature and so there are there are these patent you know uh machines

[00:49:30] these companies that are generating tens of thousands of patents a year and not innovating

[00:49:33] even a little bit um and it's completely broken in fact that itself might be an

[00:49:37] indicator that Innovation is alive and well um is because innovation has now moved to

[00:49:40] the point where the patent examiners can't keep up with the state-of-the-art they have literally no idea

[00:49:45] of what the state-of-the art is so the patents I would definitely not use right Peter

[00:49:48] same question for you what would it take to change your mind fundamentally about

[00:49:52] this well I I would I would still focus on the

[00:49:56] uh broader economic data I would focus on

[00:49:59] um I would focus on certain specific areas of innovation

[00:50:03] I think are very important uh so uh so one that I

[00:50:07] think has decelerated some but still held up is increases

[00:50:10] in life expectancy um they've decelerated but they're

[00:50:14] still going up some and so that's what I would look at very carefully if that started

[00:50:18] going up again at you know two and a half three years per decade as it had

[00:50:22] from 1840 to to 1970 um

[00:50:25] that would be a very uh very good indicator um if if that decelerates

[00:50:29] further it suggests the problems are you know the problems are even even even deeper

[00:50:33] so I think there's certain specific measures that I think are are

[00:50:37] are really critical um I certainly think um

[00:50:41] there is a cultural component to this that's very important I I don't know if I

[00:50:45] like the numbers of people in science I think we have about 100 times as many

[00:50:48] scientists as we had in the 1920s from as far as I can tell

[00:50:52] there was more innovation in the 20s than there is today so that's that leads me to think that that's

[00:50:55] that's actually not that good an indicator and I think uh you know it's about 50% of the

[00:50:59] articles that are published in science and nature magazines turn out to be inaccurate

[00:51:03] and un Incorrect and so there is sort of a lot of the scientists

[00:51:07] are sort of uh not not quite honest or

[00:51:10] being pushed in ways that are somewhat problematic and uh we should be a little

[00:51:14] bit more skeptical of that whole Enterprise at this point um but I

[00:51:18] would I would say um yeah I would say if you know

[00:51:21] I I think I I do think it's it is this uh this question of imagination

[00:51:25] it's very important I I'd come back to to an indicator that I think is

[00:51:29] an interesting cultural one sort of in Los Angeles is um

[00:51:32] if uh if Hollywood started producing science fiction movies

[00:51:36] in which technology was a good thing that would that's really important

[00:51:40] you know and um no Oblivion and the you know the only

[00:51:43] ones I can think of in this are the Star Trek retread movies

[00:51:47] which are still like a flashback to the 60s everything else it's technology

[00:51:51] is bad it's going to kill you it's going to destroy you so if um people

[00:51:55] people here stopped hating technology and started using their imagination

[00:51:59] to uh produce some good uh science fiction movies that would

[00:52:03] uh that would be a very good sign well let's hope we can uh make it so

[00:52:07] um just the final thought uh we didn't really we

[00:52:11] talked a lot about America and develop World Emerging Markets

[00:52:15] um know huge number of people out there who

[00:52:19] don't even have benefits yet of some of the the fundamental innovations that came

[00:52:22] through from you know sanitation uh electricity etc etc

[00:52:26] so people say well it's all catchup out there you know there's no innovat

[00:52:30] The Innovation is going to come from the developing world but maybe just

[00:52:33] maybe there's this huge sort of innovation coming from the ground

[00:52:37] up sort of lowcost you know the Nano car mobile

[00:52:41] payments in Africa really taking off because there's no you know banking system

[00:52:44] there to hold it back maybe some of the constraints that Mark was talking

[00:52:48] about that we have here could in Emerging Markets not be there and

[00:52:52] maybe we will see in Brazil in China India other places is a

[00:52:56] huge sort of Blossom maybe it's there already are you optimistic

[00:53:00] is that reasons that we should actually go away from here thinking we are uh actually

[00:53:03] still in accelerating um technological civilization or are you

[00:53:07] pessimistic about that well um our Venture funds

[00:53:11] offices are we have only one office in Silicon Valley and we're going to keep it

[00:53:14] that way for the foreseeable future um there's definitely been

[00:53:18] the sort of globalization of venture capital approach where people have tried

[00:53:22] to set up offices in many other countries uh the Emerging

[00:53:25] Markets um the efforts have had met with very mixed success

[00:53:29] um and the business models have generally involved sort of a globalization

[00:53:33] Arbitrage where it's um the um the Groupon of

[00:53:37] China or the Singa of of India or something

[00:53:40] like this and I tend to think um we like to invest in the first

[00:53:44] and best Technologies I tend to think that often the something of somewhere

[00:53:48] is the nothing of nowhere and and therefore that uh um

[00:53:52] the the place where the real Innovative companies are happening it seems to have gotten even more centered

[00:53:55] on Silicon Valley it's possible that once these countries catch

[00:53:59] up in 10 15 20 years um there will be Innovation

[00:54:03] but I think they are still far behind um and uh

[00:54:07] and the the place I would look outside the US is other developed

[00:54:10] countries where there's room for Innovation I would look at Israel I'd look at

[00:54:14] Scandinavia um you know maybe uh Canada maybe

[00:54:18] maybe Germany um there are other constraints on Innovation other cultural

[00:54:22] constraints in those countries but i' look at the developed world the the big

[00:54:25] place where people said things were going to get copied and overtaken was Japan

[00:54:30] and Japan copied phenomenally it caught up

[00:54:33] to the US in the 80s and then it it never overtook and it's a very

[00:54:37] open question whether this is going to happen in these other places um a culture

[00:54:40] of accelerating progress is rare it's only happened once

[00:54:44] in the history of the world um most cultures most societies

[00:54:48] were basically uh stagnant and so um it's a very important

[00:54:51] thing for us not to lose uh the sort of accelerating techn olical

[00:54:55] civilization that we've had that I think is at Great risk thank you m any so

[00:54:59] I one final on this one so I pull the num

[00:55:03] so number of public companies in the United States went from 8,800 in 1997

[00:55:07] to 4,100 today right so there's been a sustained attack on public companies

[00:55:11] in the US that has predictably cut the numbers um on the other hand the number of

[00:55:14] countries in the world went from in 1990 164 to in 2012

[00:55:19] somewhere between 190 to 206 depending who you ask

[00:55:23] um and there are various debates about that um and then there's this other New Movement The Economist

[00:55:26] Paul RoR has this uh effort to do so-called Charter cities to basically create more Hong Kongs

[00:55:30] and singapor which could take the number of countries up a lot reason I bring this up

[00:55:33] is because I think there's an opportunity for Innovation internationally that goes right

[00:55:37] back to the regulation uh topic which is regulatory competition

[00:55:41] um so various countries choosing to specialize where they want to have Innovation

[00:55:45] Eon what kind of innovation they want to have in their economy by the regulatory regimes South

[00:55:48] Korea embryonic stem cell research Japan has liberalized drug

[00:55:52] development big search of drug R&D Israel has commercial drone flights which

[00:55:55] we which are not allowed in the US the UK uh online gambling uh

[00:55:59] is allowed which means prediction markets work which they can't in the US because they're illegal

[00:56:03] um and so there's actually an opportunity for countries I think to differentiate through their regulatory

[00:56:07] structures and to have new kinds of centers of innovation as a result

[00:56:11] I actually I agree I agree with this is just a this is one place where

[00:56:14] I think um you agree we can um you know we we've

[00:56:18] been looking at a lot of these heavily regulated Industries to invest in and the question

[00:56:21] is always is there an opening for deregulation so space

[00:56:26] there was some deregulation in the US there was an opening for SpaceX to get started as a
