[Why We Stopped Progressing | Peter Thiel | EP 541](https://youtu.be/918qslcfwfY)

[00:00:00] so this question of you know is there really progress used to move faster We've stopped

[00:00:04] moving faster physically the last 50 years We feel like we are in an apocalyptic age There

[00:00:09] is a dimension of science and technology It has a dark dimension and it's you know it's a trap that

[00:00:14] humanity may be setting for itself Much of the early science was done in the monasteries that

[00:00:20] turned into universities You can think about that as concrete evidence of the underpinning

[00:00:25] of much of the scientific revolution in terms of at least the offshoots of Christianity But

[00:00:30] I think there's something deeper there It wasn't just the theological metaphysics that that drove

[00:00:34] it but something like the Christian anthropology Okay so let's delve into this a little bit [Music]

[00:00:54] So I had the opportunity to sit down with Peter Teal today and and Mr Teal is probably most

[00:01:01] famous for the role that he played in establishing PayPal but he's been a canny investor for a very

[00:01:06] long period of time and we didn't actually talk much about practicalities on the business side

[00:01:10] We mostly talked about the nature of cultural transfer transformation uh because his thought

[00:01:17] tends in that direction He's a philosophically inclined person and our discussion really walks

[00:01:24] through one of one of Peter's fundamental propositions is that progress in the material

[00:01:32] world and not the digital world let's say has slowed substantively since maybe the 1960s and

[00:01:38] that there are deep reasons for that Some of it is apocalyptic fear of the scientific endeavor Some

[00:01:44] of it is this hippie-like desire to look inside Some of it is escape into a world of abstraction

[00:01:50] And so he outlined his theory of social transformation which is also deeply influenced

[00:01:57] by a skepticism about what low-level mimetic envy predicated uh uh status games which I think has

[00:02:07] been a very wise uh target of skepticism We walked through his thoughts on social and technological

[00:02:17] transformation over a couple of hundred years concentrating more on the last 60 and also began

[00:02:23] to uh flesh out a metaphysics that might amelate some of that nihilistic pathology and malaise And

[00:02:34] that enabled us to at least begin a discussion about what metaphysical presuppositions are

[00:02:40] necessary for a society and a psyche to remain well not only healthy but non-totalitarian and

[00:02:48] catastrophic So join us for that So the last time we spoke was by distance at Ark and you said a

[00:02:58] number of things there that um were provocative and one in particular that I wanted to follow

[00:03:03] up on It it surprised me although I think I understand why you said it You're dubious about

[00:03:10] the rate of progress so to speak that we're making now you feel you seem to feel I don't want to put

[00:03:15] words in your mouth that the most innovative times are perhaps behind us or at least temporarily so

[00:03:21] and so I'm I'm I'm curious about we've seen these revolutionary steps forward in principle on the

[00:03:27] large language model front in the last year and our gadgetry is becoming much more sophisticated

[00:03:32] there's tremendous advancements in robotics and so h how do you conceptualize quantifying uh

[00:03:39] progress scientific and technological and why are you skeptical about the benefit benefits or the

[00:03:43] rate Well yeah there there variations of this that I've talked about for close to two decades at this

[00:03:51] point And uh the you know the the big and it's of course it's there all sorts of very complicated

[00:03:58] measurement problems So how do we compare progress in AI with let's say lack of progress in dementia

[00:04:05] research curing Alzheimer's and so you know so all these different complicated ways of

[00:04:10] how you weight all these different things Um but there's a there was a sense that um the west the

[00:04:17] western world was in this fast era of scientific technological progress where it was advancing on

[00:04:24] many many different fronts and you know in some ways it started picking up in the Renaissance

[00:04:31] early enlightenment uh 17th 18th centuries and then probably in important ways accelerated in

[00:04:38] the 19th first half of the 20th And uh and then in some ways I believe it's uh slowed down over

[00:04:45] the last 50 or or so years Maybe 1970 or so is a is an inflection uh point one could one could

[00:04:53] cite Uh it doesn't mean it's stopped altogether Uh you know one way I've often summarized it is

[00:04:59] that we've continued to have progress in the world of bits um you know computers software

[00:05:07] internet mobile internet you know maybe crypto now now AI uh but there's been much less progress

[00:05:15] in the world of atoms and uh if we if you think about university setting most of the uh most of

[00:05:23] the engineering and scientific subjects had to do more with this physical material world in which

[00:05:30] uh we're embedded and I was an undergraduate Stanford in the late 1980s class of ' 89 And

[00:05:37] uh you know it wasn't quite obvious at the time but in retrospect almost anything that was in the

[00:05:43] world of atoms would have been a bad field to go into Physics chemistry um mechanical engineering

[00:05:50] certainly aerrowastrogineering nuclear engineering people already knew was was kind of outlawed and

[00:05:55] over by by the 1980s uh you you could um you could it you could still maybe do electrical

[00:06:02] engineering which was sort of the atoms that were used for you know semiconductors Um but uh it it

[00:06:09] basically the only STEM field that was a really going to be a really successful field for people

[00:06:15] to go into was computer science which was kind of this marginal almost fake field because I you know

[00:06:21] I always I always have this riff where you know when you have uh when people use I'm in favor

[00:06:26] of science but I'm skeptical when people use the word science So social science political science

[00:06:32] climate science are called science but people have an inferiority complex and they deep down know

[00:06:37] they're not really rigorous scientific fields And uh and something like this was true of computer

[00:06:43] science in the original day It was it was people who were too dumb at math to be in mathematics or

[00:06:49] physics or electrical engineering and they sort of flunked out into computer science and and weirdly

[00:06:54] this was a field that worked and it had you know a decent amount of impact Um I don't think it was

[00:07:00] and then you it it was it worked on the scale of people building some fantastic companies Uh it

[00:07:07] there were certainly some important cultural and social transformations that we had as we

[00:07:12] moved from sort of the industrial age to the the information age Um I don't know if it's worked

[00:07:17] that well on let's say a broad economic level of of well-being So even if you measure it in terms

[00:07:23] of material well-being for people uh the um the millennial generation the US is probably in a lot

[00:07:31] of ways not um not even doing as well as their their baby boomer parents since it's the first

[00:07:36] time we've had this sort of economic stagnation or even outright uh outright decline And so and

[00:07:42] again the naive view would be that you know all this progress somehow translates into um a more

[00:07:48] successful economy I mean it's not the only way to measure things but it's a it's a sort of it's sort

[00:07:52] of a straightforward way to measure things And then and then when it doesn't translate it's it's

[00:07:57] uh my conclusion is maybe maybe it hasn't added up um up to as much You know one one of the reasons

[00:08:03] it's very hard by the way to to have this debate and even figure out what's going on is because

[00:08:08] one of the features of late modernity unlike early modernity is hyper specialization And

[00:08:14] uh we have ever narrower group of experts who are experts in their field So the cancer specialists

[00:08:19] tell us they will cure cancer in 5 years They've been telling us that for the last 50 um and um

[00:08:25] and then the string theorists tell us they're the smartest people in the world And it's very hard to

[00:08:30] you know evaluate these fields on their own terms which is um it's it's it's like Adam Smith had

[00:08:35] this uh concept of the pin factory where you had a hundred different people working in a pin factory

[00:08:40] and you can think of late modernity as the pin factory on steroids um we're so hyper specialized

[00:08:46] it's extremely hard to have a picture of the whole and so this question of you know is there really

[00:08:52] progress is there isn't is there not it's kind of a hard one to get at um but I think if you measure

[00:08:58] it in economic terms there's a slowed sense if you measure it in this sort of intuitive thing where

[00:09:03] okay we we'll just look at a bunch of different fields like cancer supersonic aviation you know

[00:09:08] just all these different ways used to move faster you move faster every decade from you know 1500 on

[00:09:13] it was fastaster faster sailing boats and faster railroads faster cars faster planes We've stopped

[00:09:18] moving faster physically the last 50 years So you know that's one dimension And so there sort of is

[00:09:23] a common sense way that we have stagnation There is a uh there's an economic way to measure it And

[00:09:31] um and then there's probably always a political intuition I have on this too which is uh that

[00:09:38] perhaps if you have ideas that are taboo that you're not allowed to discuss my shortcut is

[00:09:44] to suspect they're simply correct And uh and so uh the the example I always give is uh is

[00:09:51] um Professor Bob Laughlin who's a Stanford physics professor I think around 1998 he gets a Nobel

[00:09:57] Prize in physics and he suffers from the extreme delusion that now that he has a Nobel Prize he

[00:10:03] finally has academic freedom and can talk about whatever he would like to talk about and there

[00:10:08] are all sorts of areas that are very taboo in the sciences So you I mean question Darwinism

[00:10:12] or question stem cell research or uh question you know uh climate change these are very dangerous

[00:10:19] areas but he picked one of those even more dangerous than any of those three He believed

[00:10:23] that most of the scientists so-called scientists were basically stealing money from the government

[00:10:29] engaging in borderline fraudulent science or or was it was incrementalist not worth much You know

[00:10:35] his area of special uh his his area of focus was high temperature superconductivity You know he

[00:10:41] told me at one point there were maybe 50,000 papers written in that area and maybe 25 out

[00:10:46] of 50,000 um had actually advanced the science at all Mhm And um and you know I don't even need to

[00:10:53] tell you how the and then you know he he started by yeah it was not just the abstract replication

[00:10:58] crisis He started by talking about naming people and you know this person has stole money and this

[00:11:03] person is is a fraud And uh I mean I don't even need to tell you how that movie ended He

[00:11:09] promptly got defunded His students couldn't get PhDs anymore And so and then my hermeneutic of

[00:11:14] suspicion is if you have an idea like stagnation in science which immediately gets um gets you

[00:11:21] deplatformed that's an idea we should take very seriously So that's a political intuition

[00:11:25] I have on this So I have I have a few of these different ideas that uh we've we've been a lot

[00:11:30] more stuck It doesn't mean um it doesn't mean that there's been zero progress It doesn't mean that

[00:11:37] um the progress we've had has been uniformly good um it doesn't mean that people's fears about the

[00:11:44] limited progress we have are are unjustified either Maybe all these things um are actually

[00:11:51] part of the explanation for you know for why why the stagnation has happened Um now now there's

[00:11:57] a much harder question um you know and then there sort of our cultural transformations that one can

[00:12:02] describe that at least coincided with us and were correlated how causal they were is is always hard

[00:12:10] to say But uh if we sort of think of you know the Apollo space program as this last great

[00:12:18] you know technological scientific project there's some sense where July of 1969 where

[00:12:27] uh we landed on the moon and uh Woodstock started 3 weeks later and you know in with

[00:12:33] benefit of hindsight in some sense that's when progress stop scientific technological progress

[00:12:40] stopped and we and the hippies took over the country And uh you can you can describe it in many

[00:12:46] ways but um in some ways you can describe it as a shift from outer space from exploring the world

[00:12:53] outside of us to inner space And uh there were sort of all you know all these all these different

[00:13:00] uh transformations There was a there was a uh you know and I I would describe you know

[00:13:06] yoga meditation um uh I would describe you know psychedelic drugs I would describe um you know I

[00:13:14] don't know incels playing video games in basement um you know there was so all this this incredible

[00:13:20] this um maybe continued atomization the um naval gazing you know uh of identity politics in a way

[00:13:30] you know you You could say that uh you know people often lump for example they often lump

[00:13:35] Marxism and cultural Marxism together In my telling these are these are opposites because

[00:13:41] Marxism at least was primarily concerned about the outside objective material economic realities and

[00:13:49] then cultural Marxism was like the shift from Apollo to Woodstock where um you you just uh

[00:13:56] went into into the sort of interior world you no longer were thinking about this outside world and

[00:14:04] um and in some ways you you stopped asking these questions about economic growth and basic economic

[00:14:11] prosperity and um and then that coincided with u also with this lack of progress in these things So

[00:14:17] I I think there were all these kinds of cultural transformations that uh that that coincided with

[00:14:23] with this shift uh you know I I think the people often ask why why this stagnation happened My my

[00:14:34] standard or you know if you agree with this and of course people can disagree you know how much

[00:14:39] it happened but if you agree with me that there's been you know a slowing down of progress that you

[00:14:44] know in some sense the singularity was maybe more in the past than than in the future Um

[00:14:50] uh and you always have these questions why why did it happen And my copout answer is always that

[00:14:55] why questions are overdetermined And it could be you know it could be sort of a our society

[00:15:00] became riskaverse or too feminized Or you could say that uh you could say that um there was too

[00:15:07] much regulation and bureaucracy which is sort of a libertarian intuition I have Um uh but I I've come

[00:15:14] to think that one of the the bigger factors that uh w was the sense that um a lot of the science

[00:15:22] and technology was quite dangerous Um it it had a at least in a military context had a dual use

[00:15:30] uh character Um and you know this was I mean this is already there was already some relentless um

[00:15:38] acceleration of this stuff in the late 18th 19th centuries You know Napoleonic Wars Colonel Cult

[00:15:47] with the revolver Alfred Nobel inventing dynamite um you know World War I you know was sort of a

[00:15:55] a break point where you know the sort of naive progressive narrative really got undercut and um

[00:16:03] and then somehow you can you can say that the sort of Baconian science project in some sense ended

[00:16:10] were ended in the Hegelian senses both culminated and terminated at Los Alamos with the building of

[00:16:16] of of the of of nuclear weapons And then again it doesn't work perfectly but my telling would

[00:16:22] be that it took maybe a quarter century for uh nuclear weapons to really get internalized by

[00:16:28] society And then by by the 1970s um you know the the energy um you know the energy was you know we

[00:16:37] don't we don't want to be doing this outside world where we're going to build ever more thermonuclear

[00:16:41] bombs We want to be um you know piecing out at Burning Man with psychedelic drugs We want to

[00:16:48] um we want to um you know or or you or you escape back to nature through environmentalism You know

[00:16:55] we are you know we we want to be in a world not of change but of stasis because a world of change has

[00:17:02] this apocalyptic dimension Change is change for the worse That's the that's the sense that gets

[00:17:09] you know encapsulated the 1970s There's there's a way that uh the sort of progressive version of

[00:17:15] science you know we we try to you know we try to push put the pause button on it The the places the

[00:17:22] places where it's still allowed you can say are the most inert So in a way the world of bits was

[00:17:26] seen as incredibly inert because you know you're not building bombs you're not building weapons

[00:17:32] with it And um and then of course even there there's you know some sort of some sort of way in

[00:17:38] which the ideas on the internet maybe maybe they do translate into reality every now and then You

[00:17:42] know what happens on Twitter or X doesn't always stay there Most of the time it stays there So it

[00:17:48] feels like it's this extremely angry intense conversation but every now and then it still

[00:17:54] translates to the real world So the the internet you could say was allowed because it was it was it

[00:17:59] was sort of a safe space It was it was a a place where the sort of violence could be could be uh

[00:18:05] could be contained and then um even there probably not not totally and even there people felt it was

[00:18:11] like may maybe maybe too much but yes the the sort of apocalyptic background of late modernity where

[00:18:17] you know you know every microaggression has the potential to escalate to Armageddon is is is is in

[00:18:25] the background and I and again I I don't I don't like the stagnation and the risk aversion and all

[00:18:31] these responses but there's there's there's a part of it that I think is understandable Do you trust

[00:18:37] your internet service provider Well there's a good reason not to Depending on your location

[00:18:42] internet service providers may be required to log your online activity for government access In the

[00:18:46] US ISPs can legally sell your browsing history The solution A VPN like ExpressVPN It reroutes

[00:18:53] all your online traffic through encrypted servers protecting your data from ISPs and third parties

[00:18:58] But you need to trust your VPN provider as you're transferring trust from your ISP to

[00:19:02] them So why trust ExpressVPN Well they received over 300 law enforcement data requests last year

[00:19:07] and zero resulted in customer data exposure They comply with authorities as required but

[00:19:12] can't hand over what they don't have Their server architecture runs on volatile memory

[00:19:16] with nothing saved to the disk Private by design Both our hosts and production teams here at the

[00:19:21] Daily Wire use ExpressVPN to reroute their daily activity through ExpressVPN's secure encrypted

[00:19:26] server to hide their IP addresses each and every day Plus it works across all your devices as well

[00:19:32] your phones laptops tablets and connects with just one tap It's simple and easy to use So if

[00:19:37] you want the VPN we trust to protect our privacy get ExpressVPN In fact you can get four extra

[00:19:42] months of ExpressVPN for free with our special link Head over to expressvpn.com/jord That's

[00:19:48] expsvpn.com/jordan to get four extra months for free

[00:19:58] So it sounds to me now that you've clarified that it sounds to me and correct me if I'm wrong that

[00:20:04] what you're grappling with is um more of an attempt to account for where we are now and

[00:20:13] how it's different from let's say the post-war period or maybe even the Enlightenment to the

[00:20:18] post-war period Like things have shifted radically And it sounds to me like what you're outlining is

[00:20:24] a what it's an attempt to characterize the nature of that shift perhaps even more than

[00:20:31] an attempt to deny the idea that there's any progress You you said yourself when you were

[00:20:37] laying out your argument that it's very difficult to measure progress but it's also undeniable that

[00:20:42] many many things have shifted and we're not where we were let's say well 10 years ago probably and

[00:20:48] certainly not 30 years ago Well I I would say we are broadly progressing more slowly than

[00:20:53] we were 100 years ago Okay Uh we are still progressing in some dimensions They're maybe

[00:20:58] still too fast and too scary for people But uh but the big thing that has shifted visa v

[00:21:04] let's say the world of 1913 preworld war I is that uh we feel like we are in an apocalyptic

[00:21:11] age that there is that you know there is there is a dimension of science and technology that

[00:21:17] um you know has it has a dark dimension and it's you know it's a trap that humanity may be setting

[00:21:23] for itself and you know I don't like Greta and I don't like the full precautionary principle

[00:21:30] But uh you know her argument that we have just one planet isn't entirely wrong And um and so

[00:21:37] you see this shift in part as a shift from the ethos of progress that the the prior assumption

[00:21:44] Yeah But I don't want to I don't want to abstract it too much It is it is actually it's the specific

[00:21:49] nature of the progress that happened It is we got thermonuclear weapons We um we uh you know um we

[00:21:56] are powerful enough to affect the environment I'm not sure whether you know carbon dioxide is the

[00:22:00] most important dimension but the you know I there probably a lot of dimensions where the environment

[00:22:04] can be impacted in very uh very radical ways Uh we can probably build very dangerous bioweapons

[00:22:10] you maybe that's even what was going on in the Wuhan lab We can um you know there are there are

[00:22:16] dimensions of AI that are you know um potentially violent and very dangerous And you don't have to

[00:22:22] necessarily believe the the um all all these sort of weird pictures where it's this super

[00:22:29] intelligence that's somehow completely disembodied and is going to kill every last human being on the

[00:22:34] planet But there are you know there are natural ways to combine it with weapons technology that

[00:22:39] that feel um unsettling unsettling And just you know a simple example is that

[00:22:46] uh you know we have we have these this this drone technology that's that's again a new form of

[00:22:51] technology that's come to the four in the uh in the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine and

[00:22:57] uh and the um you know it's and you have a human in the loop but the human can get jammed and so

[00:23:05] the natural fix is to put AI on the drones and uh turn these into more autonomous weapon systems And

[00:23:13] that's you know that's seems inevitable That seems like the natural logical thing to do And then

[00:23:19] um even even I as a you know pro tech person have to say I find that somewhat unsettling Okay So let

[00:23:28] so let me lay these Okay So let me lay these ideas out again and and summarize So one of the threads

[00:23:35] that you were developing was let's we'll do two at the same time One was that the scientific process

[00:23:45] in terms of physical reality maybe in your view peaked in the 1960s and then you could imagine

[00:23:52] that there you you kind of outlined two maybe reasons for that One was fear of the apocalyptic

[00:23:58] consequences of that technology and an escape into various forms of abstraction Like so some of

[00:24:04] those abstractions were psychological abstractions inner journeys but some of it also was escape into

[00:24:10] digital abstraction And then you also made a case that the avenue for exploration in the digital

[00:24:16] realm was still open And so maybe we could we could understand this So and then and then and the

[00:24:22] digital realm and then some ways even even these escape swer full escapes So AI yeah that's a it

[00:24:30] seems to be just about bits not atoms but then if you combine it with a drone you know the AI comes

[00:24:36] back to the physical world Yeah Well we can we'll get back to that back to the overlap But so you

[00:24:40] could imagine that Okay So the scientific approach the method produced an explosion of technological

[00:24:48] consequences Many of them were dramatic in the physical world There was kickbacks against that

[00:24:53] One of the kicks backs was the apocalyptic element The other was the turn away from

[00:25:00] spirituality you might say But then there was also the counterposition that always develops in any

[00:25:06] after any revolution is that things get tangled up in red tape in weird ways like the scientific I

[00:25:13] was just in Usbekistan you know and they developed a pretty sophisticated industrial economy in the

[00:25:20] last 5 years and part of the reason that they could do that was because there was nothing in the

[00:25:26] way right because Usbekiststan was kind of devoid of impediments to radical entrepreneurialship

[00:25:31] ship in the aftermath of the communist default Now you could imagine that for a good time the

[00:25:37] scientific method was so powerful that it was producing revolutions non-stop and the legal

[00:25:42] and bureaucratic frameworks were lagging it and so they caught up quite remarkably by the 1970s and

[00:25:50] that left the digital space still open and it is kind of a free-for-all space Yeah But but the way

[00:25:55] the way you're telling the story this is it has too much of this timeless and eternal character

[00:26:00] this is just what always happens and progress Well that is what I'm wondering you always whereas the

[00:26:05] the story I want to tell has more of a one-time and world historical character to it where it is

[00:26:11] uh know there were lots of inventions where you know people figure out you know cures for

[00:26:16] diseases that didn't say okay now we have to take a step back and cure fewer diseases that actually

[00:26:22] encourages you to double down on that and do even more or you know we have you know we have

[00:26:27] all these machines that replace humans in in in factories and yeah there's some downsides to it

[00:26:33] and there labor problems with the industrial revolution and there's a lot of pollution but

[00:26:38] on the whole the good way outweighs the bad and it it it there was no big regulatory counter movement

[00:26:45] in in Victoria Let me make a counter example But then then we get to something like thermonuclear

[00:26:50] weapons and that had that that specifically has a very different character It has a really different

[00:26:55] character and probably I don't know by the 1950s and 1960s you know baby boomers get

[00:27:02] um you know you're a kid you get brought up on Dr Seuss and not on adventure stories and it pro it

[00:27:09] probably changes childhood education It changes the way we form and develop human beings Um and

[00:27:15] and so it yeah and then it and it leads to a a society where you know science and technology no

[00:27:24] longer have quite uh have quite this former veance Mhm There's there's always sort of an interesting

[00:27:32] big picture history question of how much uh science and technology you know were they how

[00:27:39] they were entangled with Christianity in the west and were they sort of they were they were somehow

[00:27:45] entangled but was it meant as a compliment where you know you you know you're you're you're sort of

[00:27:52] encouraged to understand God's creation and this is sort of a way that it's um you know it's uh

[00:27:59] it's a fulfillment further of a furtherance of of this or was it meant to be a substitute where it

[00:28:05] was an alternate way to build heaven on earth without without um requiring God and you know

[00:28:11] radical life extension was sort of a important part of the early modern project you know Benjamin

[00:28:18] Franklin Condors all these people thought that um you could perhaps indefinitely prolong human life

[00:28:24] and uh and then you know and and uh And and so I think early modernity you know it wasn't the only

[00:28:32] thing There were a lot of complicated things going on but but a lot of it had had sort of an anti-

[00:28:39] um anti-biblical veilance And you could say that um 17th and 18th century scientists you know uh

[00:28:48] and again this is where I think someone like um um Francis Bacon needs to be interpreted as

[00:28:54] a hardcore materialist atheist and it is we need to we need to stop religion because it's slowing

[00:29:01] down this wonderful scientific progress And then I' I've had this bacon discussion with a number

[00:29:07] of people lately and they all think no that can't be right Bacon was just this somewhat heterodox

[00:29:12] Christian and um because in late modernity where we find ourselves and again it's complicated to

[00:29:18] describe what's going on culturally but in late modernity um it's the atheist liberals that are

[00:29:25] anti-science at this point and um and so if you think about Richard Dawkins despair yeah you have

[00:29:32] to think of Richard Dawkins as a representative of early modernity he's like he's like a fossil

[00:29:37] from before 1789 the last of the enlightenment He's the last he's he's a fossil from before 1789

[00:29:44] And uh and Greta is more representative or you know think about the Hollywood atheist liberals

[00:29:51] The movies are all about technology that doesn't work It's scary And um and so to the extent um the

[00:29:57] the way the anti-Christian argument gets made in late modernity is that it's yeah it's God's fault

[00:30:03] but this time it's God's fault for putting us on this whole dangerous project in the first place

[00:30:08] And it's like yeah it's like the lines in Genesis you shall have dominion over the earth Um and

[00:30:13] uh and and so so in um se in the 17th and 18th century you know the Christian God was blamed for

[00:30:22] slowing down the scientific technological project In the 20th and 21st century uh the Christian

[00:30:28] God gets blamed for speeding it up starting it speeding up keeping it going So it's that the

[00:30:34] invariant is the Christian God always gets blamed But uh but you know the fact that it's the exact

[00:30:39] opposite tells us something um very interesting about how yeah how how this is how this is tell

[00:30:46] now that's interesting you're making the point that two opposite arguments are making that are

[00:30:51] both directed towards furthering Nichch's death of God let's say so then that begs the question

[00:30:57] what's the only the only the only point I'll make is that we're we're again in a we're in

[00:31:04] a very different place with science science and technology than we were in the 17th 18th

[00:31:09] century 17th 18th century I I don't think people would have said yeah we're going to make all this

[00:31:14] progress and there there's going to be a lot of push back and it'll get regulated Uh and no the

[00:31:18] thought was we we'll make a lot of progress and it'll be so good that it will actually

[00:31:22] then accelerate and it will you know it'll smash religion even more and then we can go even faster

[00:31:27] and it'll go even better and it's going to have this sort of unraveling accelerating effect And

[00:31:32] then um and then in the 20th 21st century we we make you know we make the opposite argument as

[00:31:39] as there are some things in this project that have have gone somewhat haywire Okay So let's

[00:31:44] let's pick up on the on the religious thread for a moment I mean I've been trying to understand the

[00:31:53] relationship between Christian Europe let's say and the dawn of the scientific age for

[00:31:59] a long time And so let me outline something for you and then I'll turn back to exactly what you

[00:32:05] said So it seems to me I mean much of the early science was done in the monasteries that turned

[00:32:12] into universities And so there's certainly a trail from Christianity through the monasteries to the

[00:32:18] universities And so you can you can think about that as concrete evidence of the underpinning of

[00:32:25] much of the scientific revolution in terms of at least the offshoots of Christianity But I

[00:32:30] think there's something deeper there And so I I've tried to make this case with Dawkins for example

[00:32:36] not least after he called himself a cultural Christian So it seems to me that for science to

[00:32:40] get going as a motivational project there are some assumptions you have to make that aren't

[00:32:45] scientific So there are axioms before the game gets going And I think they're faith-based axioms

[00:32:51] Um one is that the cosmos is intelligible that it's intelligible to the human mind and that

[00:32:58] diligent investigation of that intelligibility produces an increment in knowledge both practical

[00:33:04] both conceptual and practical And that that increment in knowledge is good But then there's

[00:33:09] a there's maybe a deeper presumption which is that increment in knowledge can be good if the point

[00:33:17] of the knowledge pursuit remains encapsulated in something like the underlying Christian ethos And

[00:33:23] then I would say that fractures in a way perhaps Bacon's a uh a turning point where the reliance on

[00:33:33] of the scientific endeavor on these metaphysical presuppositions is questioned or like when I

[00:33:41] presented Dawkins with that argument he just waved his hands over it He said he doesn't have

[00:33:46] any metaphysical assumptions underlying his brand of science But but and I think that that is what

[00:33:52] the more radical enlightenment French revolution types thought is that no we've escaped from the

[00:33:58] underlying religious ethos Okay The problem with that is it seems to me and I think this might have

[00:34:04] to do with this apocalyptic kickback is that once you unmore yourself from the underlying

[00:34:09] ethos which is even the ethos that defines what constitutes knowledge and progress itself then

[00:34:14] the luciferian element of the scientific endeavor can begin to loom extremely large Well uh well

[00:34:20] again let's let's let's start with the you know the early the early modern history And I I'm I'm

[00:34:27] always a sort of hardcore Gerardian as this uh um great uh thinker intellectual sort of

[00:34:36] um some ways um Christian polymath that I uh studied under Stanford in the late 80s 90s and

[00:34:44] uh influenced me influenced me tremendously Um and you know the these things are again very

[00:34:53] complicated intellectual history questions but uh but certainly one one intuition that that's odd

[00:34:59] about about um your telling would be that uh um you would say that you know we had sort of a law

[00:35:07] centered monotheistic tradition also in Islam also in Judaism and if we if we say there was

[00:35:14] something about Christianity that um where this this really came and it was not in the Islamic

[00:35:20] world that you got the the scientific revolution for example Um it it suggests that maybe maybe it

[00:35:26] wasn't it wasn't just the metaphysics um not just the theological metaphysics that that drove it but

[00:35:33] um but something like the Christian anthropology Gerard was fond of always saying that uh you know

[00:35:39] people focus too much in the Bible on what it tells us about God but there must also

[00:35:43] be something it tells us about man about man Yeah Okay And uh and certainly the Gerardian intuition

[00:35:51] is that one of the you know one of the things is is always that uh you know there's this really

[00:35:56] big uh problem of violence and um and scapegoating that in some ways um some sense Judaism and then

[00:36:06] Christianity um it's it's the same story It's the same story of you know sacrifice

[00:36:12] but it's told not from the point of view of the violent community It's uh told from the point of

[00:36:18] view of the innocent victim And there's there's a certain way where it sets in process this gradual

[00:36:24] um this dynamic revelation that has that leads to the sort of gradual unraveling And there are and

[00:36:31] as you stop believing in in scapegoats you're forced to come up with other explanations and

[00:36:38] um and that that includes science So for example um you can you can ask why did the witchcraft

[00:36:44] trials come to an end and the atheist scientific explanation is we got science to prove that

[00:36:51] witchcraft is impossible and um I don't think that's even been proven in 2025 because um we

[00:36:59] don't know everything Maybe it's a lost art that's been lost Um maybe um you can go to a you know you

[00:37:07] can go to a bookstore in Berkeley buy a book on how to be a witch placebo effect in magic And

[00:37:12] so but but but then the you know the the Gerardian alternate story of why the witchcraft trials ended

[00:37:19] were that uh at some point people uh realized that uh the sort of collective scapegoating in some

[00:37:26] ways was it was like a version of the of of of the um death of Christ You know the witches were

[00:37:32] not absolutely innocent like Christ but they were relatively innocent It was a community that that

[00:37:37] that went crazy And then you you know and then once you know that the witches are innocent or

[00:37:42] are relatively innocent then um then you steal yourself and force yourself to find natural

[00:37:49] explanations you know if you don't think that it was you know I don't know the Jews that poisoned

[00:37:54] the wells in the Middle Ages you know eventually some devils or or eventually or you know this was

[00:38:00] during the during the Salem witch trials there were these uh you know you had these competing

[00:38:05] sermons on Sundays and you know the initial ones were sort of that uh that um yeah the the these

[00:38:11] women were had made a packact with the devil but then the way it got reconstructed because it was

[00:38:16] right afterwards that the witchcraft trials ended and people sort of realized pretty fast

[00:38:19] they had kind of collectively lost their minds And the the alternate one was you know the devil

[00:38:24] had entered the whole community and it possessed all of Salem And those were the sermons you gave

[00:38:29] in the aftermath the witchcraft trials And um and then and then in that sort of a context you know

[00:38:37] um maybe maybe science was also a way a way to to find you know you you can steal yourself to find

[00:38:43] natural explanations when you're in an archaic you know thing Scapegoating is always an explanation

[00:38:51] It's a you know this person did this that person did this it's that person's fault And when you

[00:38:57] when you say those explanations won't do maybe you're forced to do do a scientific So there all

[00:39:03] these different threads one can one can stress But I wonder if that was also I think you have

[00:39:07] to always ask this question Um what was what was specific about the the Christian message that that

[00:39:14] really enabled this M you know I mean I I think the you know there was there was there was a way

[00:39:20] the you know there was a way the Jewish context was extremely learned and uh people you know I

[00:39:26] don't know if you if you compare um the Talmudic abilities already in the middle ages to you know

[00:39:34] understand the Bible to read it um you know it was as good or better than you know any anything that

[00:39:42] the the Christian scholastics were were doing Um but somehow it uh it it it it never really got a

[00:39:50] part of society to orient in this in this other way So again it's is you know it's obviously a

[00:39:56] complicated history Well so one of the things you pointed out there that's very interesting is that

[00:40:02] Christianity the rise of Christianity destroyed the pagan world and that's a great mystery But

[00:40:08] one of the epistemological consequences of that was the notion that deities weren't widespread

[00:40:19] That that that idea had to disappear You know the Romans had gods for their archways right So there

[00:40:25] was an idea that there were invisible spirits so to speak that were operating behind the scenes

[00:40:29] that were could easily be interpreted as causal mechanisms But you can imagine then I'm also

[00:40:35] trying to integrate this with what I learned from Jung You can imagine that as the world's

[00:40:39] desacralized at the pagan level and the kinds of interpretations that you just described are no

[00:40:45] longer tenable right There are these invisible agencies some of them personalities that are

[00:40:51] operating that isn't working anymore That gets all aggregated into a monotheistic deity and the

[00:40:57] magic gets pulled out of the world See Young Jung also pointed out that as the Christian revolution

[00:41:06] transpired the alchemical mythology started to become widespread and that there was a idea that

[00:41:13] developed that there were mysteries lurking in the material world that had redemptive capacity And so

[00:41:21] you could imagine that as the spirits are taken out of the world the suspicion you already said

[00:41:26] this the suspicion that there are other causal forces at work starts to make itself manifest

[00:41:31] in at least the imaginations of people who are on the cutting edge And so I wonder if that's a

[00:41:37] is that a inevitable consequence of the victory of Christianity over the pagan world because it

[00:41:43] gets desacralized merely because the everything that's divine gets united into a single figure

[00:41:50] I wanted to share something special with you as we transition from Lent into the Easter season You

[00:41:55] know how Lent was all about fasting and reflection Well Easter is our time to rejoice and remember

[00:42:00] that Jesus died and rose up for us Hallow has put together this amazing Easter program with Sister

[00:42:56] I think it was somewhere in Karl Marx where he says that you know all social criticism starts

[00:43:01] with a criticism of religion and um and then the the Christian addendum I would always say

[00:43:07] was that Mark Jesus Christ was the first person to actually do that really and started that whole

[00:43:13] process where you know you can think so much of it was you know calling into question the social

[00:43:19] institutions the religious institutions you know in a way deconstructing them you know you know qu

[00:43:26] and um and there's there's something about this that is um you know I I think is true I I think

[00:43:36] um I I think there is something about it that has an unraveling character Um and I don't think

[00:43:44] you can go back We can't go back to these these pagan institutions once they once they have been

[00:43:48] deconstructed And you know maybe maybe the gods get reccharacterized as demons or psychosocial

[00:43:54] phenomena or Yeah or unconscious manifestations But you know that's that doesn't sound like you

[00:44:00] know the way you really bring Zeus back you know into into the the way it would have been you know

[00:44:06] understood by you know the average uh the average person in ancient Greece or some something like

[00:44:11] that Um but but yeah I I think um you know there's a one one of the other you know dimensions that I

[00:44:21] mean Gerard it was sort of this combination of literature and anthropology but also there was

[00:44:28] always a psychological dimension to to Gerard and the the psychological intuition in in Gerard is um

[00:44:36] that there's something about um human beings being imitative that's that's very deep very important

[00:44:43] very underexplored and it is um it is that uh that uh you know you have um you have something like uh

[00:44:52] it's it's it's it's something like I believe it's an Aristotle man differs from the other

[00:44:59] animals in his greater aptitude for imitation Yeah it's a huge it's a huge difference between us and

[00:45:04] other animals And and then you could say this is like you know and of course Darwinism says

[00:45:09] our closest relatives are the apes and the apes they ape they imitate and so we differ from the

[00:45:16] apes and being more apeike than the apes If you sort of combine the aristoilian and the

[00:45:21] um Darwinian one that's that's kind of a very very strange thing in a way and then the problem

[00:45:26] you know the good thing about imitation is this is how culture gets transmitted this is how you learn

[00:45:32] language without you know without imitation you know um you know nothing like the sort of cultural

[00:45:40] edifice that we have would work um and then um and then the thing that's dangerous is it's not

[00:45:46] just on a representational level it's not just on the level of ideas that people imitate it's also

[00:45:51] on the level of desires of things they want and when everybody wants the same thing this be you

[00:45:56] know this this becomes this you know incredibly you know incredibly vile violent thing and then

[00:46:02] um and then in Jabar's understanding the the point of you know or a major point of a lot of the

[00:46:09] um laws divine laws in in these archaic societies was to you know in some sense stop imitation to

[00:46:16] prevent imitation to um you know um you will you the job you do will be the same job that your

[00:46:23] father did If you're if your father's a baker you will be a baker And this creates you know

[00:46:28] a guild system where you don't have this sort of free market competition between everybody and and

[00:46:34] it all it all goes um everybody's at everybody else's throats And then somehow you know what

[00:46:40] what's happened in late modernity in Gerard and is that as um as these institutions have unraveled

[00:46:48] there has again been this freedom to imitate like we did before we had any anything cultural

[00:46:56] at all before we had invent you know when the apes hadn't yet invented religion or um you know these

[00:47:02] these sacred structures that somehow channeled the violence and then and so in late modern eternity

[00:47:08] It's again the mimisis is is you know it it it's what makes our society dynamic Um but there are no

[00:47:17] there are no natural barriers and that's that's also you know what can give it an apocalyptic

[00:47:21] dimension or you know this and again there ways it doesn't it doesn't fully spiral into thermonuclear

[00:47:28] war all the time but or hasn't yet but you know it it has this it has this super open-ended dimension

[00:47:33] where um it can go in all these different ways you know um there's probably again we're throwing out

[00:47:40] a lot of different ideas here um there probably is you know some some kind something about

[00:47:50] um the loss of the transcendent where um you know if you have a transcendent some some transcendent

[00:47:57] reference you're not in mimemetic competition So yeah Okay I want to return to that And so um and

[00:48:04] so one of the you know one of the intuitions Gerard always had on the Ten Commandments is

[00:48:09] that the most important were the first and last on the list The first commandment you know you

[00:48:14] should only worship one God There's one God above you That's that's who you worship The the 10th

[00:48:20] commandment is the one about you know not coveting the things that belong to your neigh neighbor not

[00:48:25] being too your neighbor's ox or wife or you know this this whole set of things And it's basically

[00:48:32] when you you know when you stop looking up you start looking around And when you look around

[00:48:39] too much it's it's not a it's not a wisdom of crowds It's a madness of crowds And it's and

[00:48:45] then that is that's the envy issue And then that that is sort of where again you know it's we're

[00:48:51] not even talking about what to do about this but this is just sort of a kind of looking up to as a

[00:48:57] description I would say uh there is something about late modernity a society that's not

[00:49:04] dominated by a supernatural being that's sort of you know it's it's atheist li the liberal atheist

[00:49:10] society we live in is one where people look around a great deal It's it's a lot of very unhealthy

[00:49:18] status competition games that end up driving it Um you know I um and that's that that that would be

[00:49:26] sort of a a Gerardian description of this Yeah world where mimisis is far more out of control

[00:49:32] than ever before Don't think we can go back Um but there are all these ways it's you know it's

[00:49:38] frustrating unsatisfactory You know it it may have maybe apocalyptic but that's yeah that's a way to

[00:49:46] again understand this this history And it's it's in some ways you know downstream of Christianity

[00:49:52] It's downstream of these things being revealed Um in some ways it's it's the opposite to it You know

[00:50:00] because one of the questions you know Gerard you if you ask Gerard you know you have this theory

[00:50:05] about mimisis and there all these bad forms of misus where you have the wrong role models and

[00:50:10] you you know you and and then isn't isn't it just okay you should be less mimedic Yeah No And then

[00:50:17] uh and then of course Jar was no that's this is just the nature you can maybe choose your role

[00:50:21] model you can choose Christ but um you can't choose not to be a medic that's by by the way

[00:50:26] that's the Einrand answer where in um you know Atlas shrugged the the bad people are all the

[00:50:34] people who imitate they're the secondhanders they are the people who don't know what they want and

[00:50:39] just copy everybody else and then the really great people are the unmoved movers they're like arisat

[00:50:45] Ian gods They're not influenced by anybody and it's all from within but they're united by the

[00:50:51] same ethos across the entrepreneurs But the the Gerardian critique of Einrand would be people

[00:50:57] like that don't exist We are we all are grow up deeply in a social context There's a development

[00:51:03] to human developmental part to human biology you know Einran doesn't like to talk about children

[00:51:08] because children are you know incredibly imitative and for you know both good and bad but this is

[00:51:13] just this is just this is just the way we are But um but so yes Gerard's answer was never that you

[00:51:19] could get rid of mimisis or anything like this Um yeah or even that some kind of psychological

[00:51:26] approach would be you know that you talk about your mometic stuff with your therapist that that

[00:51:31] might make it worse right because you you'd focus on it even more and then you'd conclude

[00:51:36] you know as as in so much therapy you um you know it's it it gets marketed as self transformation

[00:51:40] and it crashes out as self-acceptance and then you probably just conclude I'm just a really mimemetic

[00:51:45] person I can't regenerates into self- worship into selfaccept self-acceptance let's say Yeah Or

[00:51:50] maybe I wish it stopped there but it doesn't And but um and then I think I think Gerard's answer

[00:51:56] would still be something like you you could just you should just go to church Okay So so let me

[00:52:02] pull apart I'd like to talk to you about sacrifice and then again about imitation I'm going to start

[00:52:08] with imitation So the psychologist that I know best who is most conversant with the ideas that

[00:52:17] you put forward is Jean Pia and Pia prioritized imitation as much as Gerard but PG's view didn't

[00:52:27] concentrate so much on the violent aspect of it he didn't concentrate so much on how imitation can go

[00:52:33] wrong the way the way I believe it was sort of this this somewhat optimistic uh you know just

[00:52:39] posit positive societies progressing through imitation Yeah Well he what he wasn't concerned

[00:52:45] precisely I would say with notions of progress from an economic perspective Like PJ's notion was

[00:52:54] that it's very much like Gerards you know is that but the way that we organize ourselves

[00:53:02] socially and and psychologically is through imitation And so Pay concentrated for example

[00:53:10] on games and so his counter to Gerard but without invalidating Gerard's point by the way is that

[00:53:18] but he was he was before Gerard right or yes he was yes definitely definitely and so PE's

[00:53:24] point was that we actually organize ourselves into social hierarchies with imitation Yes We

[00:53:32] we when children for example when they're three or four so for example you can't do

[00:53:37] this till you're three This this is how it works developmentally If a little boy asks

[00:53:41] a little girl to play house she has to agree And then what they do is they reciprocally

[00:53:47] imitate one another in relationship to a goal Okay Now so the goal in that situation is to

[00:53:55] to abstract and model the domestic environment But then there's a higher order principle that

[00:54:02] regulates that which is that in order for it to be play both of them have to be voluntarily

[00:54:10] in accordance with the aim and they have to be learning dynamically Yes Okay So now your point

[00:54:16] I think was that so now imagine a world where there's an indefinite number of these imitate

[00:54:22] imitation predicated games because there is an indefinite number of them Now what you

[00:54:29] what I think happened in the religious framework particularly in the Christian framework that that

[00:54:35] multitude of games each of which is potentially a little tower of babel is organized underneath

[00:54:41] a higher order principle Now you said that Gerard's answer was you you implied aim up

[00:54:46] but you also implied go back to church Now see there's there let me just finish one thought

[00:54:51] So imagine that there are metag games under which imitative games could be organized Okay one metag

[00:54:59] game would be power Another metag game might be hedonistic self-gratification The Christian

[00:55:06] metagame is voluntary self-sacrifice Right That's a radical that's a radical reshifting of the

[00:55:13] metagame territory And I think it is irreplaceable And and I think it has to be embodied and not

[00:55:23] propositionalized So the the pagan world the Roman world the Greek world they're they were

[00:55:30] essentially predicated on power and hedonism right If I could then I had a right to And if I could

[00:55:37] impose force on you then I was the better man And that was inverted in Christianity But it was

[00:55:42] inverted in a way I think that matches maturation I mean your point seemed to be that the imitative

[00:55:48] capacity can go dreadfully wrong if the games degenerate into envious status competitions And

[00:55:55] the other point I think was that they will degenerate into envious status composition

[00:56:00] competitions unless they're oriented towards something transcendent So then the question would

[00:56:04] be what would that transcendent orientation be I want to tell you all why my team and I

[00:56:10] founded Peterson Academy First it's because the technology is there It's now possible to

[00:56:16] identify and gather the greatest lectures and thinkers alive today and to put them

[00:56:20] in a position where they can offer their best to all who are interested Second advanced education

[00:56:27] is far more expensive than necessary Students who complete a 4-year degree risk crippling

[00:56:32] themselves with debt just when they're starting their lives and their careers Third reason because

[00:56:39] of ideological and institutional corruption I watched that process painfully unfold for

[00:56:45] 40 years at McGill at Harvard at the University of Toronto What's the alternative at Peterson

[00:56:51] Academy Well we have 40 stellar professors on board We have 34 8-hour courses taught at the

[00:56:59] highest level of quality with maximum efficiency And there's much more to come Find your purpose

[00:57:04] sharpen your wit and bring to bear on your own life the knowledge being offered to you by the

[00:57:10] best in the world Go to petersonacademy.com for the details Enroll and change your

[00:57:15] life Well um let me see I there's many many different threads here but I would say uh Gerard's

[00:57:30] Yeah Gerard would reference people like Pia and said that you know they underestimated imitation

[00:57:37] massively They whitewash it It's you know I if you ignore this allimportant you know runaway

[00:57:44] violence dimension and things like this Yeah Well P was not a psychopathologist right He was a study

[00:57:50] of normative development Yeah And and then and then I think Gerard intuition was much more that

[00:57:56] uh you know in some sense um the so-called normal case is is the less important one It's the it's

[00:58:05] the extreme case It's where you know it's it's the madness of crowds You know that's that's an

[00:58:10] extremely important case Uh and hey fair enough it's not and you know PJ also was PJ would have

[00:58:18] been like Malcolm Gladwell in the wisdom of crowds The crowds are wise because they imitate each

[00:58:22] other and this is how a lot of stuff works But he did he did bind it by the necessity of voluntary

[00:58:27] play Right That's an important dist Sure All these ways was still within some some structure But

[00:58:33] uh but you could you could always say this is uh this is a basic difference between enlightenment

[00:58:38] rationalism and uh biblical revelation is you know um you know in in in the Bible the crowd is always

[00:58:46] wrong The crowd is always crazy It is mad It's you know the Tower of Babel in part it's it's

[00:58:52] the unonymity it's the unonyimity it's um and um and uh and enlightenment rationality it's always

[00:59:02] you know democracy is good the more people vote for something the more rational it is although

[00:59:07] you know at some point you get 99.99% of the people who vote for something and you're in North

[00:59:11] Korea and so and so you know it's very important question when do you go from wisdom of crowds to

[00:59:18] uh to the madness of crowds and I think yeah that's a very important I think the

[00:59:22] the Gerardian and I would say Christian intuition is that it happens much sooner and in a much more

[00:59:28] representative way than than than you have to than than you you think and that you know uh and this

[00:59:36] is yeah um and so and um so that's that's that's sort of one one dimension I don't I don't know if

[00:59:45] I would um I would anchor it as much on sacrifice though as the as the the key feature Um and again

[00:59:53] this is one of the places where Gerard argued that it it's Christianity was in Gerard's telling is

[01:00:02] anti-sacrificial It is um it is a move away from sacrifice you know all these theories about um the

[01:00:09] substitutionary atonement of Christ's death but even if even if we go with a sort of traditional

[01:00:16] theological movement away from the sacrifice of others Christ well it is it is Christ's death

[01:00:21] is supposed to be the last one he Christ made the sacrifice so we do not have to make it and

[01:00:28] um and uh and and then yeah you can say it is a sacrifice of others versus the sacrifice of

[01:00:37] self You could say that but but you could say uh the way Gerard would put the stress would be that

[01:00:45] um you refused It's it's not there was some virtue in Christ sacrificing himself He's not like some I

[01:00:52] don't know some some enlight some sort of silly hero saying you know please let the lions come

[01:00:59] and eat me up or something like that you know giving some sort of dramatic announcement It

[01:01:03] said Christ at Gethsemane you know it it's still praying please let this cup be taken away from

[01:01:09] me It is So it is it's not you know um this is um this is you know a wonderful necessary thing to do

[01:01:17] at all It's it's it's quite the opposite Uh but um you could say it is the refusal to sacrifice

[01:01:25] others that characterizes Christ Well definitely that because we're not willing we're not willing

[01:01:31] you know not willing to resort to violence You're not willing you won't aren't willing to call down

[01:01:36] all the angels from heaven to stop the crucifixion And so um and so it's the refu it's it's a refusal

[01:01:43] to sacrifice others But um and then and then yeah may maybe in in some context you have to

[01:01:49] lay down your life your friends There things like that that happen But I but I think it's

[01:01:54] it's it's it's much more you know the anti the anti-sacrificial intuition and you have this

[01:02:00] already in you know a number of the Old Testament prophets I think it's Hosea where it's you know

[01:02:04] you know God desires mercy and not sacrifice you know the you know so so it's it's you know and and

[01:02:11] then this is you know these are sort of in a way in a way you can think of the old testament law

[01:02:15] as a sacrificial set of laws as centered on the temple and we have this sort of elaborate set of

[01:02:20] of of sacrifices and then you know in some sense Christ replaces it with you know love the lord

[01:02:30] your god with all your heart and mind and uh love your neighbor as yourself and um and then

[01:02:36] pay attention to the moment and and then we we we could say we could say it's and then you know he

[01:02:42] he says he's not getting rid of the Old Testament law not but but if you just if you do those two

[01:02:49] things you don't need any of the Old Testament law anymore You can you can even eat you can even

[01:02:55] eat bacon and pork Right Right Right And which was a really really bad thing to do under the

[01:03:00] Old Testament law Okay So let's delve into this a little bit I I want to make this psychological and

[01:03:05] sociological as well as theological So it strikes me that the RA one of the radical characteristics

[01:03:15] of human beings we talked about imitation that's certainly one Another radical characteristic is

[01:03:21] the willingness and ability to make sacrifices So let let me define that for a minute and and

[01:03:27] then we can see how it goes astray as well So the more immature you are the more your

[01:03:35] attention and behavior is under the dominion of biological systems that have narrow short-term

[01:03:41] gratification as their focus That could be rage it could be hunger could be temperature regulation A

[01:03:47] 2-year-old is a collection of unruly competing short-term motivations It takes 18 years for

[01:03:54] the cortex to develop And you could think of the cortex as an inhibitory structure So that's kind

[01:03:59] of a Freudian model Or you could think about it as an integrative structure And that's a

[01:04:03] better model Part of PGE's model is useful in that regard because we integrate within the confines of

[01:04:09] imitative games But but there's more to it than that So as you become more mature this kind of

[01:04:14] a definition of maturity you focus more on the tomorrow and next month and next year So your

[01:04:22] temporal span of apprehension increases and you regulate your behavior in the present in

[01:04:27] relationship to the future That's a sacrificial move because you're sacrificing immediate

[01:04:32] gratification for the stability of the future And then there's another let me push back on on just

[01:04:38] that description Is it a sacrificial move or is it a rational move Because there's there's some

[01:04:45] way in which I think it's both It's it's rational once you can see the future right It's but it's

[01:04:53] it's it's sort of very um it's to the extent it's rational it may not be that sacrificial

[01:05:01] You know you save you save money in order to buy a house But I don't imagine but I don't think you

[01:05:06] believe that people can regulate that with mere rationality Like it has to be deeper I would say

[01:05:11] part of that regulation of short-term impulse that's so limbically driven mere rationality

[01:05:18] won't do the trick and the rationality itself would have to be encapsulated within a concept

[01:05:23] of what actually constitutes rationality So cuz like I could ask you what's worth sacrificing

[01:05:29] your short-term pleasure for Now the pleasure speaks for itself right There has to be something

[01:05:35] that you're giving that up for when you work for example that you regard as worthwhile And it isn't

[01:05:41] also clear to me that that's a purely rational move Now there's one more sacrificial element

[01:05:46] It's like as you mature it becomes less and less about what the motivated subcomponents of you of

[01:05:54] you want now and more about how you find harmony and competition and cooperation in social groups

[01:06:01] So for example one of the things children have to learn between two and three to be social is

[01:06:07] to take turns And that's also a sacrifice because this the the default is it's always my turn That's

[01:06:14] what it is like for non-social animals for example Man I um but if this is where I want to push back

[01:06:21] a little bit man where I I don't I don't think you tell a two or threeyear-old this in the language

[01:06:29] of sacrifice And um no you probably act it out for them You It's It's It's If you don't take turns

[01:06:37] um something bad and you won't have friends and or the kids the other kids tell the kids though Yeah

[01:06:43] There are some there's there's some very pretty fast immediate consequences to it And um and again

[01:06:51] you don't say it's rational but but it is um it's it's sort of uh you you you learn evidence to to

[01:06:57] to do these things And then the place where I'm uncomfortable with using the sort of language of

[01:07:04] sacrifice is that um that the the evidence-based nonrational part of it if that's all we have left

[01:07:14] you know I I I wonder whether those are the sacrifices that uh that we should make for

[01:07:20] you I can give lots of examples but um um you know there you know there's always a question about you

[01:07:27] know what should be done about academia they're you know all all the conservative academics are

[01:07:32] being expelled It's so hard to do this right here And and there's sort of a there's a version of a

[01:07:37] debate I've had with a lot of um right of center people over the last 20 years where it's well we

[01:07:46] just you know we we need to just train more people with PhDs and they we need and then they have to

[01:07:52] keep trying to sneak into the system and have to somehow break in Yeah And um and I there's sort

[01:08:00] of a lot of reasons to think this is hard to do or might not work Um but um but uh the way I push

[01:08:07] back on it is it strikes me as an irrational kind of sacrifice And so from the point of view of a

[01:08:13] young person who is going to be a right-wing academic with a PhD and will be completely

[01:08:19] unemployable um that's not a that's not a rational sacrifice they made It's a very foolish choice

[01:08:27] that perhaps this language of sacrifice confused confused things and u and then the non-sacrificial

[01:08:34] move you know is roughly like what you yourself did with you know the University of Toronto where

[01:08:41] you you were where it's at some point I am not putting up with these silly sacrifices they're

[01:08:46] making me make in academia I'm not sacrificing my mind or I'm not you know I'm not playing by

[01:08:52] all their silly rules And um and I think that was the correct thing to do Again I would describe it

[01:08:58] as as the anti-sacrificial move The sacrificial move would be you know you have a tenure position

[01:09:04] there and you you might be unhappy about it but you know for the greater good you have to stay

[01:09:09] there Okay So so I there were things I wasn't willing to sacrifice to stay there There's no

[01:09:16] doubt about that But I would also say that and and and and I think those were irrational things that

[01:09:20] you should not have sacrificed I think No I think I think you made totally the right decision But I

[01:09:26] would also say I would describe it as the way I would describe it and maybe maybe this just

[01:09:31] shows how the language of sacrifice is confusing But but I would I would describe it as um you

[01:09:37] refused to make the sacrifices that were demanded of you because they were silly irrational crazy In

[01:09:42] relation to what See that's the issue because I think that's true But in relation to things that

[01:09:47] again maybe can't be fully rationally defined but in relation to some of the alternatives you could

[01:09:52] do in in relation to um you know maybe even even maybe even something as stupid as what you found

[01:09:59] hydonically enjoyable right It's again it did you find it enjoyable sitting on silly faculty

[01:10:06] committees as a tenure professor or did you find it boring And um and it wasn't fun The boredom

[01:10:14] wasn't fun And it's not the only reason to leave It's not maybe it's not a sufficient reason but

[01:10:20] but and from my perspective it's it it's a good partial reason And there were probably a lot of

[01:10:28] things like this that added up I was unwilling to sacrifice my tongue And so what I sacrificed

[01:10:34] was my job and my clinical career so I could keep my tongue But there's a Christian element to that

[01:10:41] too because the Christian insistence is that the truth oriented word establishes the order That's

[01:10:48] good And so but but it I don't think we can escape the sacrificial language because I had to give up

[01:10:54] my job both of them I had three because I had a private business But but again I um I don't want

[01:11:02] to make this too arrandizing to you but but I I think what you're doing is far better far more

[01:11:08] important now I I'm certainly not unhappy about it So if if um if you had if you had sacrificed

[01:11:14] your job and you were completely unemployable and had no economic prospects um you know you could

[01:11:21] describe it as sacrificing your job so you could express yourself but if nobody's listening to you

[01:11:27] um that might that might be a pretty irrational thing to do again I and so it was I think it was

[01:11:33] a yeah it was it's it's rational for you to focus on reaching a much larger audience for you to do

[01:11:39] all these things and um and I I think those were good decisions you didn't let you you didn't let

[01:11:47] um let's say um the moralizing left-wing people in academia academia get to you You didn't let

[01:11:57] their value system control you their value system is that you know there's nothing more important

[01:12:01] than academia This is the this is the world that really matters This is this is where you have to

[01:12:05] fight the battles He said um no you you you didn't let that morality control you So I I would yeah I

[01:12:13] would I would describe it as Christian or maybe Nietian but anti-sacrificial what you did in a

[01:12:20] very good way Yeah Yeah Well I I I understand I understand what you're saying but then then the

[01:12:26] metal layer would be this this is where um maybe just the language of sacrifice is is is often more

[01:12:33] confusing than helpful Well I think it it also to some degree it it stems it likely stems from

[01:12:41] your saturation in the Gerardian view because you're you can correct me again if I'm wrong

[01:12:48] you're likely and especially given what you said about Christ's sacrifice making further sacrifices

[01:12:53] in some ways unnecessary your view is is is going to be to concentrate it seems to me on the more

[01:13:01] pathological end of the sacrificial process and like I think that the terminology can be confusing

[01:13:09] because I would say what I gained was far greater than what I lost now that doesn't mean that what I

[01:13:15] lost was nothing because it wasn't nothing and it took a fair bit of reconstruction to make things

[01:13:20] work And so you could say well if you gain more than you lose is that truly a sacrifice Now the

[01:13:27] biblical stories are replete with paradoxes like that because the most intense one obviously is

[01:13:33] what happens with Abraham and Isaac because God calls on Abraham to sacrifice his son and Abraham

[01:13:39] is willing to do so But the consequence of that is that he gets his son back right And so that that

[01:13:47] points to the ambiguity of what I want to push back on all of these things You know I'm yes I

[01:13:54] I I will uh confess to being an unreonstructed Gerardian Um and there were probably ways Gerard

[01:14:00] modified his views more than I have And so he probably towards the end of his life was more

[01:14:05] open to sacrifice And I I stick with the Gerard of the 70s and 80s who was more categorically

[01:14:10] uh uh skeptical of it Um you know I think let me let me do an alternate cut on on on on on one one

[01:14:23] one story And there's a one of these Bible stories And I always think one needs to interpret the Old

[01:14:29] Testament through the New Testament This is sort of the that it this is sort of again a Christian

[01:14:34] bias I have that it doesn't fully make sense on its own You need to interpret it through

[01:14:39] uh in the light of the New And so there's there's a passage in the New Testament I'm not get the ver

[01:14:45] I don't have the verse memorized but um it's it's basically where Christ says one must have faith

[01:14:50] like a child Mhm Um um and then there's it's again you can think it's like an abstract thing

[01:14:59] but maybe it's maybe it's again we should always think more concretely And the concrete question I

[01:15:04] would have is is there a faith of a child that's being highlighted as um especially noteworthy and

[01:15:13] worthy of of um emulation And I I think there is in fact one child whose faith gets described in

[01:15:24] uh the Old Testament um and we never seem to talk about it Um and it's Isaac because um as

[01:15:32] they're as they're going up the mountain you know yeah Abraham tells Isaac this fictional story you

[01:15:39] know maybe God will provide something else and you know that's that's that's what might happen

[01:15:45] And then Isaac just believes that Isaac believe Abraham believes he has to make sacrifice That's

[01:15:50] that's the that's the delusional faith of an adult who's read too much Kirkagard or something And

[01:15:57] um and um Isaac's is the true Christian faith that uh God will figure out a way where

[01:16:05] um where the sacrifice doesn't need to happen God is not a violent God The violence doesn't come

[01:16:10] from God He's a loving God And there is a way to do this without sacrifice And I'm I'm always Yeah

[01:16:18] What I find so odd about the the Abraham Isaac story is that um we've written endless amounts has

[01:16:27] been written on the faith of Abraham or Abraham is seen as the iconic person with faith and it's

[01:16:32] it's again linked to a certain conception of sacrifice and uh and yet we have the line in

[01:16:38] the New Testament where Christ tells us to look at the faith of a child Um maybe you can come up with

[01:16:43] a better example I think the concrete one is Isaac and um and it is interesting that it's not written

[01:16:50] from his perspective The end we get we get enough of Isaac's perspective implicitly in the story

[01:16:55] that it's all the reviews all the when we talk about you know whose faith should we emulate Yeah

[01:17:01] The theologians the philosophers they always tell us you need to emulate the faith of of Abraham

[01:17:08] um the way I I understand Christ uh I understand him to be telling me to emulate the faith of Isaac

[01:17:14] which I think is is is very different and maybe maybe also very different on this on this question

[01:17:21] of sacrifice there there always are questions how one interpretates uh the the Christian account

[01:17:27] and I I believe in the physical resurrection of Christ both as an event that happened historically

[01:17:33] but also as a promise um and in some sense you know um following Christ there may be all sorts

[01:17:41] of bad things that happen to you but um it's a rational trade for saving your soul and for having

[01:17:48] eternal life And so if you if you think of it in the context of saving your soul and eternal life

[01:17:58] uh you know we can call that a sacrifice but it has a very different character right That's why

[01:18:04] he says his yoke is light which is a weird thing to say when it's an invitation to the cross But

[01:18:09] but but you have to you know the non-sacrificial way I would say it is yeah if if you believe in a

[01:18:16] literal you know eternal life that's that's one sort of thing If you think these are just some

[01:18:22] sort of Junian archetype story then you end up with uh much more of um sacrifice quas sacrifice

[01:18:30] as as uh as a as a really high value That's that's why I I would always interpret uh the Orthodox

[01:18:39] Christian message as as very anti-sacrificial very non-sacrificial and you know maybe I don't

[01:18:46] like the word rational but um uh just uh you're you're you're making a good choice a wise choice

[01:18:53] Okay Okay Got it Got it Okay So I'm going to stop us here And so this is what we're going

[01:18:59] to do on the Daily Wire side All you watching and listening know we do an extra half an hour

[01:19:04] I want to continue our conversation about the faith of a child but I I also want to ask you

[01:19:11] why you think if you think it's true that you are temperamentally inclined to focus

[01:19:17] on the dark side and I'd like to know what the consequence of that has been cuz that's

[01:19:23] something we actually share in common You know unlike PJ I'm a psychopathologist right He was

[01:19:28] a developmental psychologist and I've always been interested in the extreme case And so I'd like to

[01:19:34] talk to you about this faith issue that you just described I'd like to talk to you a bit more about

[01:19:39] Christianity and I'd like to talk to you about what it is you think that it is about you that's

[01:19:45] focused you on that on the more apocalyptic and dark edge of things So all right So everybody
