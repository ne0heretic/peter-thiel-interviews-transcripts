[Peter Thiel REJECTS Sacrifice - Watch Him Debate Jordan Peterson ](https://youtu.be/urk9BJIxZ3U)

[00:00:00] I'd like to talk to you about sacrifice and then again about imitation.

[00:00:04] I'm going to start with imitation. So

[00:00:07] the psychologist that I know best who

[00:00:11] is most conversant with the ideas that you put forward is Jean

[00:00:15] Pia and Pia prioritized

[00:00:18] imitation as much as Gerard but PG's

[00:00:22] view >> didn't concentrate so much on the violent

[00:00:26] aspect of it. He didn't concentrate so much on how imitation can

[00:00:29] go wrong. >> The way the way I believe was sort of this this somewhat optimistic

[00:00:33] uh you know just positive societies

[00:00:37] progressing through imitation. >> Yeah. Well, he would he

[00:00:40] wasn't concerned precisely, I would say, with notions of

[00:00:44] progress from an economic perspective. Like PJ's

[00:00:49] notion was that

[00:00:54] it's very much like Gerards, you know, is is that >> but

[00:00:57] the way that we organize ourselves socially and and psychologically

[00:01:02] is through imitation. And so PE

[00:01:06] concentrated for example on games and so his

[00:01:10] counter to Gerard but without invalidating Gerard's point by the

[00:01:13] way is that but he was he was before Gerard right or >> yes he was

[00:01:17] yes definitely definitely and so PE's

[00:01:20] point was that we actually organize ourselves into

[00:01:24] social hierarchies with imitation. >> Yes.

[00:01:28] We we when children, for example, when they're three or four,

[00:01:32] >> so for example, you can't do this till you're three. This this is how it

[00:01:35] works developmentally. If a little boy asks a little girl to play house,

[00:01:39] >> she has to agree. And then what they do is they

[00:01:43] reciprocally imitate one another in relationship

[00:01:47] to a goal. Okay. Now, so the goal in that situation is

[00:01:51] >> to to abstract and model

[00:01:55] the domestic environment. But then there's a higher order principle that

[00:01:59] regulates that which is that in order for it to be play

[00:02:03] both of them have to be voluntarily in accordance

[00:02:07] with the aim and they have to be learning dynamically.

[00:02:11] Yes. >> Okay. So now your point I think was that

[00:02:14] so now imagine a world where there's an indefinite number of

[00:02:18] these imitate imitation predicated games because there is an indefinite

[00:02:22] number of them. Now what you what

[00:02:26] I think happened in the religious framework particularly in the Christian

[00:02:29] framework that that multitude of games each of which is

[00:02:33] potentially a little tower of babel is organized

[00:02:37] underneath a higher order principle. Now you said that Gerard's

[00:02:40] answer was you you implied aim up but you also implied go back

[00:02:44] to church. Now see there's there let me just finish one thought.

[00:02:48] So imagine that there are metag games under

[00:02:51] which imitative games could be organized. Okay,

[00:02:55] one metag game would be power. >> Another metag game might

[00:02:59] be hedonistic self-gratification. The Christian

[00:03:02] metagame is voluntary self-sacrifice. Right? That's

[00:03:06] a radical that's a radical reshifting of the metagame

[00:03:10] territory. And I think it is

[00:03:14] irreplaceable. And and I think it has to be

[00:03:17] embodied and not propositionalized. So

[00:03:22] the the pagan world, the Roman world, the Greek world, they're

[00:03:25] they were essentially predicated on power and hedonism,

[00:03:29] right? If I could, then I had a right to. And

[00:03:32] if I could impose force on you, then I was the

[00:03:36] better man. And that was inverted in Christianity. But it was inverted in

[00:03:40] a way, I think, that matches maturation. I mean your point seemed to be that

[00:03:43] the imitative capacity can go dreadfully wrong if

[00:03:47] the games degenerate into envious status competitions

[00:03:51] and the other point I think was that they will degenerate into

[00:03:55] envious status composition competitions unless they're oriented

[00:03:58] towards something transcendent. So then the question would be what would that transcendent

[00:04:02] orientation be? Well, um, let me see. I

[00:04:06] there's many, many different threads here, but I would say, uh,

[00:04:11] Gerard's, yeah, Gerard would reference people like Pia

[00:04:15] and said that, you know, they underestimated

[00:04:19] imitation massively, they whitewash it, it's, you

[00:04:22] know, I if you ignore this allimportant, you know, runaway

[00:04:26] violence dimension and things like this. >> Yeah. Well, P was not

[00:04:30] a psychopathologist, right? He was a study of normative development.

[00:04:33] >> Yeah. And and then and then I think Gerard

[00:04:37] intuition was much more that uh you know in some sense

[00:04:41] um the so-called normal case is is

[00:04:45] the less important one. It's the it's the extreme case. It's where you

[00:04:48] know it's it's the madness of crowds. You know that's

[00:04:52] that's an extremely important case. Uh and

[00:04:55] fair enough. It's not and you know and PJ also was

[00:04:59] PJ would have been like Malcolm Gladwell in the wisdom of crowds the crowds are wise because

[00:05:03] they imitate each other and this is how a lot of stuff works >> right but he didn't

[00:05:07] he did bind it by the necessity of voluntary play right that's an

[00:05:10] important dist all these ways was still within some some structure

[00:05:14] but uh but you could you could always say this is uh

[00:05:18] this is a basic difference between enlightenment rationalism and

[00:05:21] uh biblical revelation is you know um you know

[00:05:26] in in in in the Bible, the crowd is always wrong.

[00:05:29] The crowd is always crazy. It is mad. It's, you know, the

[00:05:33] Tower of Babel. It's in part, it's it's the unonymity. It's the unonyimity.

[00:05:37] >> It's um and um and

[00:05:41] uh and enlightenment rationality. It's always, you

[00:05:45] know, democracy is good. The more people vote for something, the more rational

[00:05:48] it is. Although, you know, at some point you get 99.99%

[00:05:52] of the people who vote for something and you're in North Korea. >> And so, And

[00:05:55] so you know it's very important question when do you go from wisdom of crowds

[00:05:59] to uh to the madness of crowds and I think >> yeah that's a very important

[00:06:03] question the Gerardian and I would say Christian intuition

[00:06:07] is that it happens much sooner and in a much more representative

[00:06:11] way than than than you have to than than you you think

[00:06:15] and that you know uh and

[00:06:18] this is yeah um and so and

[00:06:22] um so that's that's that's sort of one one dimension I don't

[00:06:26] I don't know if I would

[00:06:29] um I would anchor it as much on sacrifice though as the as

[00:06:34] the the key feature. Um and again this is one of the places where

[00:06:38] Gerard argued that it it's Christianity

[00:06:42] was in Gerard's telling is anti-sacrificial.

[00:06:45] It is um it is a move away from sacrifice. you know all

[00:06:49] these theories about um the substitutionary atonement

[00:06:53] of Christ's death but even if even if we go with

[00:06:57] a sort of traditional theological >> movement away from the sacrifice of others

[00:07:00] >> Christ well it is it is Christ's death is supposed to

[00:07:04] be the last one he Christ made the sacrifice

[00:07:08] so we do not have to make it and um and

[00:07:11] uh and and then yeah you can say it is a sacrifice

[00:07:16] of others versus the sacrifice of self.

[00:07:20] You could say that >> but but you could say uh

[00:07:24] the way Gerard would put the stress would be that um

[00:07:27] you refused. It's it's not there was some virtue in Christ

[00:07:31] sacrificing himself. He's not like some I don't know some some

[00:07:35] enlight some sort of silly hero

[00:07:39] saying you know please let the lions come and eat me up or something like that

[00:07:43] you know giving some sort of dramatic announcement. It said Christ at Gethsemane,

[00:07:47] you know, it it's still praying, please let this cup be taken away from me.

[00:07:51] It is. So, it is it's not, you know, um

[00:07:55] this is um this is, you know, a wonderful necessary thing to

[00:07:58] do at all. It's it's it's quite the opposite.

[00:08:02] Uh but um you could say it is the refusal

[00:08:06] to sacrifice others that characterizes Christ. And

[00:08:09] well, definitely that because >> we're not willing we're not willing, you know,

[00:08:13] not willing to resort to violence. You're not willing,

[00:08:17] you won't aren't willing to call down all the angels from heaven to stop the crucifixion.

[00:08:21] And so um and so it's the refu it's it's a

[00:08:25] refusal to sacrifice others. But um and then

[00:08:28] and then yeah, may maybe in in some context you have to lay down

[00:08:32] your life, your friends. There things like that that happen. But I but

[00:08:35] I think it's it's it's it's much more you know the anti

[00:08:39] the anti-sacrificial intuition and you have this already in you know a

[00:08:43] number of the Old Testament prophets. I think it's Hosea where it's you know you

[00:08:46] know God desires mercy and not sacrifice you know the you know

[00:08:50] so so it's it's you know and and then this is you

[00:08:53] know these are sort of in a way in a way you can think of the old testament law as

[00:08:57] a sacrificial set of laws centered on the temple and

[00:09:01] we have this sort of elaborate set of of of sacrifices and then

[00:09:05] you know in some sense Christ replaces it

[00:09:09] with you know love the lord your god with

[00:09:13] all your heart and mind and uh love your neighbor as yourself

[00:09:17] >> and um >> and then pay attention to the moment >> and and then we we we

[00:09:21] could say we could say it's and then you know he he

[00:09:25] says he's not getting rid of the Old Testament law not >> but

[00:09:29] but if you just if you do those two things >> you

[00:09:32] don't need any of the Old Testament law anymore. You can

[00:09:36] >> you can even eat you can even eat bacon and pork. >> Right. Right. Right. >> And

[00:09:40] which was a really really bad thing to do under the Old Testament law. >> Okay.

[00:09:43] So let's delve into this a little bit. I I want to make this psychological

[00:09:47] and sociological as well as theological. So

[00:09:51] it strikes me that

[00:09:55] the RA one of the radical characteristics of human beings,

[00:09:58] we talked about imitation, that's certainly one. Another radical characteristic

[00:10:02] is the willingness and ability to make sacrifices.

[00:10:06] So let let me define that for a minute and and then we can see how it goes

[00:10:10] astray as well. So

[00:10:13] the more immature you are, the more your attention

[00:10:17] and behavior is under the dominion of biological

[00:10:21] systems that have narrow short-term gratification as their focus.

[00:10:25] That could be rage, it could be hunger, could be temperature regulation.

[00:10:29] A 2-year-old is a collection of unruly competing

[00:10:33] short-term motivations. It takes 18 years for the

[00:10:36] cortex to develop. And you could think of the cortex as an

[00:10:40] inhibitory structure. So that's kind of a Freudian model. Or you could think about it as

[00:10:43] an integrative structure. And that's a better model. Part of PJ's

[00:10:47] model is useful in that regard because we integrate within the confines

[00:10:51] of imitative games. But but there's more to it than that. So

[00:10:55] >> as you become more mature, this kind of a definition of maturity,

[00:10:59] >> you focus more on the tomorrow and

[00:11:02] next month and next year. So your temporal span of apprehension

[00:11:06] increases and you regulate your behavior in the present in

[00:11:09] relationship to the future. That's a sacrificial move because you're

[00:11:13] sacrificing immediate gratification for the stability

[00:11:17] of the future. As a spouse, a parent, or a

[00:11:20] leader, people count on you. But if you're constantly tired, unfocused, and

[00:11:24] just not feeling like yourself, how can you show up the way they need you to?

[00:12:09] >> And then there's another >> Let me push back on on just that description.

[00:12:12] Is it a sacrificial move or is it a rational move? Because

[00:12:17] there's there's some way in which >> I think it's both.

[00:12:21] >> It's both. It's rational once you can see the future,

[00:12:25] >> right? It's but it's it's it's sort of very

[00:12:29] um it's to the extent it's rational,

[00:12:33] >> it may not be that sacrificial. You know, you save you save money in order to buy

[00:12:36] a house. >> But I don't imagine but I don't think you believe that people

[00:12:40] can regulate that with mere rationality. Like it has to be deeper.

[00:12:44] I would say part of that regulation of short-term impulse that's

[00:12:47] so limbically driven mere rationality

[00:12:51] won't do the trick and the rationality itself would have to be

[00:12:55] encapsulated within a concept of what actually constitutes rationality.

[00:12:59] So, cuz like I could ask you, what's worth sacrificing your

[00:13:02] short-term pleasure for? Now, the pleasure speaks for itself,

[00:13:06] right? There has to be something that you're giving that up for when you

[00:13:10] work, for example, that you regard as worthwhile. And

[00:13:14] it isn't also clear to me that that's a purely rational move. Now,

[00:13:17] there's one more sacrificial element. It's like as you mature,

[00:13:22] it becomes less and less about what the motivated subcomponents

[00:13:26] of you of you want now and more about

[00:13:30] how you find harmony and competition and cooperation in social

[00:13:34] groups. So for example, one of the things children have to

[00:13:37] learn between two and three to be social is to take

[00:13:41] turns. And that's also a sacrifice because this the the

[00:13:45] default is it's always my turn. That's what it is like for non-social

[00:13:49] animals, for example. >> Man, I um but

[00:13:53] if this is where I want to push back a little bit more, man, where

[00:13:57] >> I I don't I don't think you tell a two or threeyear-old

[00:14:00] this in the language of sacrifice. And

[00:14:04] um >> no, you probably act it out for them. >> You It's It's

[00:14:08] if you don't take turns um something

[00:14:12] and you won't have friends and >> or the kids the other kids tell the kids that. Yeah,

[00:14:16] there are some there's there's some very >> pretty fast

[00:14:20] immediate consequences to it. >> And um and

[00:14:23] again, you don't say it's rational, but but it is um it's

[00:14:27] it's sort of uh you you you learn pretty fast to to

[00:14:31] to do these things. And then the place where I'm

[00:14:34] uncomfortable with using the sort of language of sacrifice

[00:14:38] is that um that the the

[00:14:43] evidence-based nonrational part of it if that's all we

[00:14:46] have left you know I I I wonder whether those are the sacrifices

[00:14:51] that uh that we should make for I can give lots

[00:14:54] of examples but um um

[00:14:58] you know there you know there's always a question about you know what should be done about academia

[00:15:02] they're you know, all all the conservative academics

[00:15:05] are being expelled. It's so hard to do this >> right here. >> And and there's

[00:15:09] sort of a there's a version of a debate I've had with a lot of

[00:15:14] um right of center people over the

[00:15:18] last 20 years where it's well, we just, you know, we we need to

[00:15:21] just train more people with PhDs and they we need and

[00:15:25] then they have to keep trying to sneak into the system and have to somehow break in.

[00:15:29] >> Yeah. And um and I

[00:15:32] there's sort of a lot of reasons to think this is hard to do or might not work.

[00:15:36] Um but um but uh the way I

[00:15:40] push back on it is it strikes me as an irrational kind

[00:15:43] of sacrifice. And so from the point of view of a young

[00:15:47] person who is going to be a right-wing academic with

[00:15:51] a PhD and will be completely unemployable, um that's not

[00:15:54] a that's not a rational sacrifice they made. It's a

[00:15:58] very foolish choice that perhaps this language of sacrifice

[00:16:03] confused confused things and um and then the

[00:16:07] non-sacrificial move you know is roughly like

[00:16:10] what you yourself did with you know the University of Toronto where

[00:16:14] you you were where it's at some point I am not putting

[00:16:18] up with these silly sacrifices they're making me make in academia. I'm

[00:16:22] not sacrificing my mind or I'm not, you know, I'm not playing

[00:16:25] by all their silly rules. And um and I

[00:16:29] think that was the correct thing to do. But again, I would describe it as as the

[00:16:32] anti-sacrificial move. The sacrificial move would be, >> you

[00:16:36] know, you have a tender position there and you you might be unhappy about it, but

[00:16:40] you know, for the greater good, you have to stay there.

[00:16:44] >> Okay. So So I there were things I wasn't

[00:16:47] willing to sacrifice to stay there. There's no doubt about that. But I would also say

[00:16:51] that >> and and and I think those were irrational things that you should not have sacrificed.

[00:16:56] >> I think I think I think you made totally the right decision.

[00:17:00] I would also say I would describe it as >> the way I would describe it and maybe

[00:17:03] maybe this just shows how the language of sacrifice is confusing. But

[00:17:07] >> but I would I would describe it as um you refused to

[00:17:11] make the sacrifices that were demanded of you because they were silly, irrational,

[00:17:15] crazy. >> In relation to what? See, that's the issue because I think that's true.

[00:17:18] But in relation to things that again maybe can't be fully rationally

[00:17:22] defined but in relation to some of the alternatives you could do

[00:17:26] in in relation to um you know maybe even even

[00:17:30] maybe even something as stupid as what you found hydonically

[00:17:33] enjoyable right it's again it did you find

[00:17:37] it enjoyable sitting on silly faculty committees as

[00:17:40] a tenure professor or did you find it boring

[00:17:44] and um and it wasn't fun the boredom wasn't on

[00:17:48] and it's not the only reason to leave. It's not maybe it's not a sufficient

[00:17:52] reason, but but and from my perspective,

[00:17:56] it's it it's a good partial reason. >> So,

[00:18:00] there were probably a lot of things like this that added up. >> I was unwilling to

[00:18:04] sacrifice my tongue. And so, what I sacrificed was my

[00:18:08] job >> and my clinical career so I

[00:18:11] could keep my tongue. But there's a Christian element to that too because

[00:18:15] the Christian insistence is that the truth oriented

[00:18:19] word establishes the order. That's good. And so

[00:18:23] but but it I don't think we can escape the sacrificial language because

[00:18:26] I had to give up my job both of them. I had three because

[00:18:30] I had a private business. But but but again I

[00:18:34] um I don't want to make this too arrandizing to you, but but

[00:18:37] I I think what you're doing is far better, far more important

[00:18:42] now. >> I I'm certainly not unhappy about it. So if if um if you

[00:18:45] had if you had sacrificed your job and you were

[00:18:49] completely unemployable and had no economic prospects

[00:18:53] um you know you could describe it as sacrificing your job

[00:18:56] so you could express yourself but if nobody's listening to you

[00:19:00] um that might that might be a pretty irrational thing to do. again

[00:19:04] I and so it was I think it was a yeah it was it's

[00:19:07] it's rational for you to focus on reaching a much larger

[00:19:11] audience for you to do all these things and um and

[00:19:15] I think I think those were good decisions. You didn't let

[00:19:19] you you didn't let um let's say

[00:19:23] um the moralizing left-wing people in academia

[00:19:27] academia get to you. You didn't let their value system

[00:19:31] control you. their value system is that you know there's nothing more important than

[00:19:34] academia. This is the this is the world that really matters. This is this

[00:19:38] is where you have to fight the battles. He said um no

[00:19:42] you you you didn't let that morality control you. So I I

[00:19:45] would yeah I would I would describe it as Christian

[00:19:49] or maybe Nietian but anti-sacrificial what you did

[00:19:53] in a very good way. >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, I I I

[00:19:57] understand I understand what you're saying, >> but then then the metal layer would be this

[00:20:00] is where um maybe just the language of sacrifice is

[00:20:05] is is often more confusing than helpful.

[00:20:08] >> Well, I think it it also to some degree it it stems

[00:20:12] it likely stems from your saturation

[00:20:16] in the Gerardian view because you're you can correct

[00:20:20] me again if I'm wrong. you're likely and especially given

[00:20:23] what you said about Christ's sacrifice making further sacrifices

[00:20:27] in some ways unnecessary your view is

[00:20:30] is is going to be to concentrate it seems to me

[00:20:34] on the more pathological end of the sacrificial process and

[00:20:38] like I think that the terminology

[00:20:41] can be confusing because I would say what I gained

[00:20:45] was far greater than what I lost now that doesn't mean that what I lost

[00:20:49] was nothing because it wasn't nothing and it took took a fair bit of reconstruction

[00:20:52] to make things work. And so you could say, well, if you gain

[00:20:56] more than you lose, is that truly a sacrifice? Now,

[00:21:00] the biblical stories are replete with paradoxes like that because

[00:21:04] the most intense one obviously is what happens with Abraham and Isaac

[00:21:08] because God calls on Abraham to sacrifice his son and

[00:21:12] Abraham is willing to do so, but the consequence of

[00:21:15] that is that he gets his son back, right? And so

[00:21:20] >> that that points to the ambiguity of what sacrifice

[00:21:23] I want to push back on all of these things. You know, I'm yes,

[00:21:27] I I I will uh confess to being an unreonstructed

[00:21:31] Gerardian. Um and there were probably ways Gerard modified his views

[00:21:35] more than I have. And so he probably towards the end of his life was more open

[00:21:38] to sacrifice. And I I stick with the Gerard of the 70s and 80s who was

[00:21:42] more categorically uh uh skeptical

[00:21:46] of it. Um, you know, I

[00:21:49] think let me let me do an alternate

[00:21:53] cut on on on on on one one

[00:21:57] story. And there's a one of these Bible stories. And I always think one

[00:22:01] needs to interpret the Old Testament through the New Testament.

[00:22:04] This is sort of the that it this is sort of again a Christian bias

[00:22:08] I have that it doesn't fully make sense on its own. You need to interpret it

[00:22:11] >> through uh in the light of the New. And so there's there's

[00:22:15] a passage in the New Testament. I might get the ver I don't have the

[00:22:19] verse memorized, but um it's it's basically where Christ says one

[00:22:22] must have faith like a child. >> Mhm.

[00:22:26] >> Um um and then

[00:22:29] there's it's again you can think it's like an abstract thing, but maybe

[00:22:33] it's maybe it's again we should always think more concretely. And the concrete

[00:22:37] question I would have is, is there a faith of a child

[00:22:41] that's being highlighted as um especially

[00:22:45] noteworthy and worthy of of

[00:22:49] um emulation? And I I think there is in fact

[00:22:53] one child whose faith gets described

[00:22:57] in uh the Old Testament um and we never

[00:23:00] seem to talk about it. Um, and it's Isaac

[00:23:04] because um, as they're as they're going up the mountain,

[00:23:08] you know, yeah, >> Abraham tells Isaac this fictional story,

[00:23:12] you know, maybe God will provide something else and, you know,

[00:23:16] that's that's that's what might happen. And then Isaac just

[00:23:19] believes that Isaac believe Abraham believes he has to make sacrifice.

[00:23:23] That's that's the that's the delusional faith of an adult

[00:23:27] who's read too much Kirkagard or something. And um

[00:23:31] and um Isaac's is the true Christian faith that

[00:23:35] uh God will figure out a way where um

[00:23:39] where the sacrifice doesn't need to happen. God is not a violent God. The

[00:23:43] violence doesn't come from God. He's a loving God. And there is

[00:23:46] a way to do this without sacrifice. And I'm I'm always

[00:23:50] Yeah. What I find so odd about the the Abraham

[00:23:55] Isaac story is that um we've

[00:23:59] written endless amounts has been written on the faith of Abraham or Abraham

[00:24:02] is seen as the iconic person with faith and it's it's again

[00:24:06] >> linked to a certain conception of sacrifice and uh and

[00:24:10] yet we have the line in the New Testament where Christ tells us to look at the

[00:24:13] faith of a child. Um maybe you can come up with a better example.

[00:24:17] I think the concrete one is Isaac >> and um

[00:24:21] >> and it is interesting and it's not written from his perspective the end >> but we

[00:24:24] get we get enough of Isaac's perspective implicitly in the story

[00:24:28] but it's all the reviews all the we talk about you know

[00:24:32] whose faith should we emulate yeah the theologians

[00:24:35] the philosophers they always tell us you need to emulate the faith

[00:24:39] of of Abraham um the way I

[00:24:43] I understand Christ uh I understand him to be telling me to emulate

[00:24:47] the faith of Isaac which I think is is is

[00:24:50] is very different and maybe maybe also very different on this on this

[00:24:54] question of sacrifice. There there always are questions how one interprets

[00:24:58] uh the the Christian account and I I believe in the physical

[00:25:02] resurrection of Christ both as an event that happened

[00:25:05] historically but also as a promise um and

[00:25:09] in some sense uh you know um

[00:25:12] following Christ there may be all sorts of bad things that happen to

[00:25:16] you but um it's a rational trade for saving

[00:25:20] your soul and for having eternal life and so

[00:25:24] if you if you think of it in the context of

[00:25:28] saving your soul and eternal life

[00:25:31] uh you know we can call that a sacrifice but

[00:25:35] it has a very different character >> right that's why he says his yoke is light

[00:25:39] >> which is a weird thing to say when it's an invitation to the cross >> but but but

[00:25:43] you have to you know the non-sacrificial way I would say it is

[00:25:46] yeah if if you believe in a literal

[00:25:50] you know eternal life that's that's one sort of thing

[00:25:54] if you think these are just some sort of Jungian archetype

[00:25:57] story, then you end up with uh much more of

[00:26:01] um sacrifice quas sacrifice as as

[00:26:05] uh as a really high value. But that's that's

[00:26:08] why I I would always interpret uh the Orthodox

[00:26:12] Christian message as as very anti-sacrificial,

[00:26:16] very non-sacrificial, and you know, maybe I don't like the word

[00:26:20] rational, but um just uh

[00:26:23] you're you're you're making a good choice, a wise choice. [Music]
