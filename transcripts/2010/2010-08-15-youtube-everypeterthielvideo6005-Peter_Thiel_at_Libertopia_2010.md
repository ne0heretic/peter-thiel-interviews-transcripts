[00:00:00] [Music]

[00:00:10] we have this election coming up in um in two three weeks

[00:00:14] uh where uh you know you have um very uh

[00:00:18] Choice that's presented to you on the one hand you can vote for

[00:00:22] taxing and spending and uh regulation

[00:00:26] and redistribution um or you can vote for the Democrats

[00:00:31] and uh and so I I wanted to maybe get PE get make started with

[00:00:34] a little bit of interactivity and um assume that

[00:00:38] you know I can be the libertarian dictator and

[00:00:42] and we're only going to allow uh two parties on the ballot we're going to allow

[00:00:46] the objectivists and the anarchists and

[00:00:50] um do sort of a uh um an alternate

[00:00:53] election right now on the spot and see who would

[00:00:57] who would vote for the objectivist party

[00:01:02] and how about the anarchist party

[00:01:07] and how about uh and how about um what

[00:01:10] what what what even even if we had that how many

[00:01:14] of you would uh would be skeptical of voting

[00:01:18] as the best way of deciding things versus

[00:01:22] how many would I sort of gotcha on that one but anyway

[00:01:26] um and so I want to I want to reflect a little bit on

[00:01:30] on um talk a little bit about my my Evolution

[00:01:34] my thinking you know I've been a Libertarian pro- free market for

[00:01:38] you know as long as I can remember but my thinking about

[00:01:42] how that intersect with the political system has changed a lot over the

[00:01:45] years um when I was a teenager studying uh political

[00:01:49] philosophy at Stanford in the 80s it seemed like

[00:01:53] uh the right way to advance ideas was through the give and take

[00:01:56] of debate and through elections and sort of try to get a lot of people

[00:02:00] to be convinced of your views and of your side started one of these

[00:02:04] uh student newspapers we had you know there were sort of

[00:02:08] we had our minor victories we managed to get this the schools

[00:02:11] uh Speech code overturned but uh an awful lot of it

[00:02:15] had this feeling like it was trench warfare in World War I

[00:02:18] where you had you know wellestablished battle lines there was just tons

[00:02:22] of Carnage but the front lines never really moved and

[00:02:26] um and in retrospect you know it maybe had the benefit that we

[00:02:30] sort of preaching to the choir and uh and it had sort of the side

[00:02:33] benefit that the members of the choir uh kept singing for the rest of their

[00:02:37] lives but um but it didn't really uh move

[00:02:41] at uh at at shifting people and um and

[00:02:44] as as people sort of grow older they tend to sort of become disillusioned

[00:02:48] with things the world's too big a place it's too hard to change things

[00:02:52] and um and sort of by the T by the early 90s um

[00:02:56] you know I sort of realized that the people who were were

[00:03:00] um who were sort of politically not part

[00:03:04] of the uh The Establishment system um you could basically measure

[00:03:08] people's IQ very simply by how optimistic they

[00:03:12] were about politics and sort of the dumb people tended to think you should

[00:03:15] really all vote um the um the smarter people

[00:03:19] thought it was probably a bad thing but you know you still had to maintain appearances

[00:03:24] and then the really smart people were just sort of a despondent and

[00:03:28] the ones who were conservative uh engaged in you know heroic amounts of

[00:03:31] alcohol consumption and um the people who were libertarian

[00:03:35] did not limit themselves to alcohol

[00:03:39] and um and so basically uh

[00:03:42] and and you know but I don't think you know I don't think despair

[00:03:46] is the only answer and I don't think and it's because I don't think politics

[00:03:50] is the only way to go and my my thinking on this

[00:03:54] uh you know started to take a turn towards a more optimistic perspective

[00:03:58] in the mid to late 0s when I got involved in the tech boom in Silicon Valley

[00:04:03] uh I ended up being the co-founder of company called PayPal

[00:04:07] where um and the initial founding Vision was that we were

[00:04:11] going to use technology to change the whole world and basically

[00:04:15] overturn on the monetary system of the world and you know

[00:04:19] we can debate on how much it succeeded or how little it

[00:04:22] succeeded um and there were parts of it that I I think have

[00:04:26] worked and parts of it where you know the jury is still out but the basic idea was

[00:04:30] that uh we could never win an election on

[00:04:34] um on on getting certain things because we were

[00:04:37] in such a small minority but maybe you could actually unilaterally

[00:04:41] change the world without having to constantly convince people and beg

[00:04:45] people and plead with people who are never going to agree with you through technological

[00:04:49] means and this is where I think um technology is

[00:04:53] this incredible alternative to politics and uh

[00:04:56] and you know there are a number of different Technologies we can outline but the

[00:05:00] the task in this world where politics has become so broken and so

[00:05:04] dysfunctional is to find a way to escape from it it's

[00:05:07] not a way to fix it it is a way to escape and uh

[00:05:11] there are you know a number of different options I think the uh the promising

[00:05:15] one of the 1990s and this last decade has been to escape onto

[00:05:18] the internet and to sort of create an alternate virtual reality

[00:05:23] uh questions of course is still how does it intersect with the real world

[00:05:26] there are I think escaping to outer space um

[00:05:30] is a promise uh although I think the space technolog is not quite there so I

[00:05:33] think that's sort of for the second half of the 21st century I think we

[00:05:37] can try to uh you know create autonomous countries on oceans

[00:05:41] underwater all sorts of other spaces but I think technology

[00:05:45] is the vehicle for how we should um we should be looking to

[00:05:49] uh to escape and move Beyond uh Beyond Politics as we find

[00:05:53] it today um I want to uh

[00:05:57] offer two quick thought two basic thoughts and then

[00:06:00] open it a little bit of discussion and and debate on um

[00:06:04] the limits of this so I have sort of one thought on um a caveat

[00:06:08] to this technology as an alternative and then end with the

[00:06:11] caveat to the caveat so the big caveat to

[00:06:15] uh technology as a standalone autonomous force

[00:06:19] is that politics is going to try to stop it and I think

[00:06:23] we should not underestimate the degree to which there is a race in

[00:06:26] our society between politics and Technology and it's an

[00:06:30] very open question whether technology is going to

[00:06:34] succeed on its own in escaping from the black hole of

[00:06:37] politics or whether uh somehow the system will

[00:06:41] will collapse and on itself and I I think you know I think actually

[00:06:45] the correct in a sense attitude for people

[00:06:49] who are anarchists or libertarian or objectivists is to

[00:06:53] uh is to not be insanely optimistic

[00:06:57] or insanely pessimistic because insane optimism or pessimism

[00:07:00] means that history just has this force of its own and that there's no

[00:07:04] room for individual choice I think it really is actually instead a very

[00:07:07] close thing and maybe politics wins maybe technology wins

[00:07:11] but it's not not exactly clear which it is uh one one

[00:07:15] of the things that I've been spending a lot of time thinking about over the last year

[00:07:19] is this question of whether technology has simply been winning and I think it's

[00:07:23] uh it's not as straightforward and optimistic as

[00:07:26] optimistic a case as I would have made a decade ago so caveat

[00:07:30] to my optimism is that we've had a lot of progress in computers

[00:07:33] and the internet there are all sorts of other areas where there's been a lot less progress than

[00:07:37] we would like uh space travel is not where people thought it was

[00:07:41] going to be in 1968 the future history of Star Trek first original

[00:07:44] series 1967 was permanent lunar bases by 1980

[00:07:48] Martian colonies by 1990 we would be at Alpha andry

[00:07:52] by now 2001 Space Odyssey was 2001

[00:07:55] was when you had the man expedition to Jupiter uh

[00:07:59] and uh and so there sort of are number of things on the space side that

[00:08:03] haven't quite lived up to expectations I think biotechnology is not happening

[00:08:06] as quickly as it should energy is not happening as quickly as it should and when we look at

[00:08:10] the areas of technology that have happened quickly versus the ones that have not

[00:08:14] I think the basic thing is that uh the ones that are massively

[00:08:18] regulated are not happening the ones that are unregulated are happening

[00:08:21] the reason the computer Revolution is happened in the last 40 years is the government forgot

[00:08:25] to regulate computers um people didn't think computers actually

[00:08:29] matter mattered they thought this was just Bill Gates who had Asperger syndrome

[00:08:32] and was um best allowed to just play in his room by himself with

[00:08:36] his computer um and um and that's why that happened

[00:08:40] whereas a lot of these other areas have been basically regulated death

[00:08:43] even in something like medicine um the area where there's been the most progress

[00:08:47] in the last 20 30 years has been in plastic surgery and things

[00:08:51] like that because that was considered too unimportant to regulate

[00:08:55] and so I think we we we need to really think very hard about

[00:08:59] um you know the one sort of caveat to

[00:09:02] the political is that it is perhaps stopping technology which is our

[00:09:06] is our main is our main Escape Route from um

[00:09:10] from politics ultimately and this is sort of where I think you have this this insane

[00:09:14] um very very close contest uh one you know one

[00:09:18] one sort of thought on on um the current

[00:09:21] um the current situation um and is that

[00:09:25] I think we've had um we''ve had this sort of Keynesian approach

[00:09:29] to economics for close to 80 years in the US

[00:09:33] and you know we all suspect that there's something you know very wrong

[00:09:37] about keynesianism it hasn't worked you know there's something that seems a little

[00:09:40] bit fraudulent about printing money and some people getting it other people not

[00:09:44] and so there's some sort of a um sort of trick that's being

[00:09:47] played where somehow the money is being moved around very quickly and some people

[00:09:51] end up with more than others um but I think one of the sort

[00:09:55] of strange questions that is worth asking is why has it even sort

[00:09:58] of worked why why do we have a world where people can sort of think that

[00:10:02] it's worked for 70 or 80 years which is quite a long

[00:10:05] time uh people would never have believed in something like keynesianism in

[00:10:09] the Middle Ages or um in in the 16th century

[00:10:13] and I would submit to you one of the reasons it has sort of been working

[00:10:17] for the last 80 years is because it happened against this

[00:10:20] backdrop of insane acceleration in technology and

[00:10:24] if you had this technological motor where the society was growing 2

[00:10:28] 3 4% a year you could actually do a lot of

[00:10:31] dumb things and it could still keep growing pretty quickly

[00:10:35] um and where where I think today is very different from the

[00:10:39] 1930s is that the technological motor is starting to sputter

[00:10:43] and the same things that led to keyy and big government have led to

[00:10:46] a regulation of technology and that is in in effect

[00:10:50] actually slowing down and stopping the Keynesian uh project

[00:10:54] today so when people um talk about deficit and

[00:10:57] spending in the United States people often you know if you had massive

[00:11:01] technological progress this would not be that big a problem you could double

[00:11:05] the debt and you double the economy in 20 years and it sort of roughly

[00:11:08] cancels out it may not be the best thing to do but you could actually get away with it

[00:11:12] there's a sense we can't get away with it anymore because there is a sense

[00:11:16] that the uh technological acceleration isn't working quite

[00:11:19] as fast as people thought and that's where I think uh the canian

[00:11:24] state has sort of reached this this phase where it has

[00:11:27] self-destructed it's sort of like it the parasites have eaten

[00:11:31] up um all the animals they were feasting on

[00:11:34] and there's nothing left and so they are close to starving themselves

[00:11:38] which is you know we don't necessarily we don't want the parasites

[00:11:42] it's not good for them to be starving in the sense that it means uh the animals they've been feasting

[00:11:46] on are are in trouble but uh but something like that I think is

[00:11:49] a description of what's happening today and this is a place where it's very

[00:11:53] very different from the 1930s uh and the 1930s formula

[00:11:57] um however badly it worked in the 1930s would work even less

[00:12:00] well today because um technological innovation was still happening

[00:12:04] in an enormous way in the 1930s the government was not regulating Howard Hughes and

[00:12:08] flying airplanes you could not be Howard Hughes today if you were flying

[00:12:11] airplanes over Beverly Hills without a license experimental airplanes

[00:12:15] that might crash into buildings and stuff um this would not be allowed you'd

[00:12:19] not be allowed to go to the Moon there's 20% chance of someone dying on the flight to the moon

[00:12:23] no way you could not go to the Moon um you could

[00:12:27] not get an experimental cancer drug you could not you know

[00:12:30] a whole series of these things have have sort of gotten very limited

[00:12:35] and so even though I believe technology is the way out

[00:12:39] and even though I think um politics is bad and voting is bad

[00:12:42] the one caveat is that we have to be very sensitive to the degree to

[00:12:46] which um politics has been constraining technology

[00:12:50] and in which you know the race is closer than we we might like we

[00:12:54] might like it just to be winning automatically but I think it is actually a very

[00:12:57] very close race um now my my caveat to the

[00:13:01] caveat and I'll I'll end with this thought and then open it to more of a

[00:13:05] give and take of a discussion is that uh is

[00:13:08] that uh we should never forget even if

[00:13:12] we have to in small measure engage in politics

[00:13:16] we should never forget how evil and distasteful and bad it really

[00:13:19] is and so you know if you um if you

[00:13:23] uh I think I think it is only a small exaggeration

[00:13:27] to say that um to uh you know that the

[00:13:31] government is so um is so fundamentally evil

[00:13:35] that to deny um the evil nature of the government is equal

[00:13:39] to denying the existence of the devil

[00:13:43] and um I I think that actually I think that sort of double

[00:13:46] negative works both for people who believe in the devil and people who don't

[00:13:50] um and then um and then you know on the flip side

[00:13:55] um if the individual is to become sovereign you

[00:13:58] think think of the most Sovereign thing in the world as something like

[00:14:02] God um you you basically achieving individual

[00:14:06] sovereignty means that you get to be God or you get to be

[00:14:10] uh as close to God as is as is possible for anybody on this planet

[00:14:14] to be uh and I think it is better to try to be

[00:14:17] God or to be like God um than to be be making a

[00:14:21] pact with a devil or with something like the devil

[00:14:24] uh I think it is better for us to try to do something uh Noble than

[00:14:28] to uh spend the rest of our lives trying to make compromises

[00:14:32] with the base thank you very [Applause]

[00:14:46] much yes sir well

[00:14:51] us ising great restrictions

[00:14:54] on technology but there are other countries that China

[00:14:58] for with eny

[00:15:02] you think about technology progress in

[00:15:06] China I you know I'm I'm fairly skeptical of what's

[00:15:09] actually happening uh you know we uh there certainly

[00:15:13] has been this uh widespread view among Silicon Valley venture

[00:15:17] capitalists that they should be investing in China and India um it's been an

[00:15:20] absolute disaster that people have tried to do it over the last decade

[00:15:24] and so the fact that people have not made money there makes me at least a little bit

[00:15:27] skeptical of the of the story of incredible progress my

[00:15:31] my own my own sense is the economic incentives

[00:15:35] are that you only really want need to be pushing technology in the most advanced

[00:15:39] countries the less Advanced countries for the most part just need

[00:15:43] to be copying the advanced countries so I think the the business model

[00:15:46] for China for the next 20 years is to copy the US

[00:15:50] and U you know if you're a talented person in China you should be building bridges building

[00:15:54] airports you know just doing things that have already been done and the task

[00:15:58] is to sort of build 19th Century Plumbing and 20th Century railroads

[00:16:02] or something like that and it's not necessarily to be really innovating

[00:16:06] at the um at the edge of technology and so I think you

[00:16:09] know I think the tech story with China is very uh is very overrated

[00:16:13] so I think and I think the the place where people actually have the incentives are

[00:16:17] us Japan Western Europe you know maybe you know some

[00:16:21] smaller places like Israel um and within the sort

[00:16:24] of confines of the developed world the US is actually still

[00:16:28] uh is still the most free or the least nonfree

[00:16:32] uh place um and so that's why that's why unfortunately

[00:16:36] the politics in the US matter a great deal yes

[00:16:40] sir why is technology intrinsically good

[00:16:43] toal the

[00:16:48] both created by the government

[00:16:51] one um well I think the uh I don't think

[00:16:56] I don't think technology is intrinsically intrinsically

[00:17:00] good I do think that uh I do

[00:17:03] think that in our world opposition to technology is

[00:17:07] intrinsically evil so let me uh sort of make it frame it as

[00:17:11] a double negative so if we think about where our planet is we have 6.8

[00:17:14] billion people today um we are

[00:17:18] Geared for massive technological progress uh these

[00:17:21] people would like to have the same standard of living like we have in the US

[00:17:25] people in the US uh will be very depressed if the living standards aren't

[00:17:29] a little bit higher in the Next Generation the present one one of the big issues

[00:17:32] is this malaise where people think things are are are actually not not

[00:17:36] getting better if you if you have 6.8 billion

[00:17:40] people and you try to get them up to the standard of living of the US

[00:17:44] that is a formula for um a malthusian struggle for resources

[00:17:48] abs and technological innovation so uh we are

[00:17:51] I'm not going to say technology or technological progress is

[00:17:55] necessary in all times and all places it is necessary

[00:17:59] in our world if you want to avoid a World

[00:18:03] War I'm concerned about the Mis of

[00:18:07] Technology like I can exchange a pre

[00:18:11] 1964 silver coin in

[00:18:15] an exchange and nobody can trace that versus

[00:18:18] paying by debit card PayPal or whatever

[00:18:22] that can be Trace mised

[00:18:25] uh I just wonder how

[00:18:29] contractually technolog

[00:18:33] um great great similar question so techn it's again similar

[00:18:37] theme about the uh the potential for abusing technology

[00:18:41] I would I would say um I would I would say the uh the generalized

[00:18:45] version of your question is does increase transparency

[00:18:48] is that a good thing or a bad thing and you know I think it's an ambiguous

[00:18:52] thing increased transparency um could be bad to the

[00:18:55] extent means the government has more transparency into you and can monitor you

[00:18:59] at all times and all places um it is a good thing

[00:19:03] to the extent that we have more transparency going on into the government

[00:19:07] um my judgment would be that onet transparency is a plus

[00:19:11] although I can definitely understand the arguments both ways for example

[00:19:15] I do not think you could have World War I happen again

[00:19:18] today you know if you had people with um

[00:19:22] with cell phones and uh video cameras and

[00:19:26] it got posted on YouTube and people saw the Carnage firsthand

[00:19:30] uh it would not be possible for that to happen uh it's

[00:19:34] you know we can still have wars of various sorts we might have a catastrophic nuclear

[00:19:37] war there definitely things that can go wrong but there are certain modalities

[00:19:41] of behavior that uh that just don't happen anymore if you take the uh

[00:19:45] if you take sort of the uh the torture type stuff that happened um

[00:19:48] in the last decade um I'm I'm not sure

[00:19:52] I I suspect things like this happen in all previous Wars the US was involved

[00:19:56] in and the difference was we became aware of it this time and

[00:19:59] so I think that the transparency has been has been powerfully

[00:20:03] helpful in my mind uh the ability of transparency to

[00:20:07] undermine um war is is a plus that off weighs

[00:20:11] outweighs many other negatives but I understand there can be you know some important differences

[00:20:15] about that um

[00:20:19] given that uh technology like the internet uh

[00:20:23] leads to um more information that provides

[00:20:26] uh activities and ideas for people to either increase their freedom

[00:20:30] or else in the WR hand decrease their freedom what non

[00:20:34] technological work you think can be done to improve

[00:20:37] the content of the information on the internet Le more freedom

[00:20:41] uh in conjunction with the grow computers

[00:20:45] and more access to techology people have actual content

[00:20:48] Information Technology you know

[00:20:52] I I I think there is well I think there is a lot of

[00:20:56] content things one could do I my my my hope would be

[00:20:59] that sort of a lot of good ideas come out in the process of of having

[00:21:03] this greater Freedom what I've personally decided to focus on is the

[00:21:07] technology itself I tried the content route in the 80s

[00:21:10] 90s I felt that a lot of it led to just um

[00:21:14] you know hopeless kinds of debates that

[00:21:17] never never LED anywhere and so I my my own view is

[00:21:21] that the biggest Leverage is to actually change the technology and

[00:21:24] thereby try to change the society um and I'm I'm

[00:21:28] I'm confident there will be enough other people to to drive the content and

[00:21:32] I hope that uh it will be pushed in a direction that uh where transparency

[00:21:36] undermines the existing um you know injustices of the existing

[00:21:40] social political order yes next

[00:21:44] article a couple decades that

[00:21:47] what was missing what was most missing in

[00:21:52] countes were established institutions

[00:21:55] of widespread respect for

[00:22:00] transactions to our property recation

[00:22:04] methods our insurance IND

[00:22:09] Etc to the extent that PayPal

[00:22:13] can fill to what exent

[00:22:18] you think payp and any others

[00:22:21] like it and interational way to supply

[00:22:26] those institutions of mutual

[00:22:30] and well my my vision at the time I started

[00:22:34] PayPal 99 was that we would get rid of all central banks

[00:22:37] you know overnight uh it's taken a little bit longer than I expected I was

[00:22:41] optimistic about that um but I I

[00:22:45] do think um I do think that to the extent it becomes easier

[00:22:48] for people to shift out of one currency into another

[00:22:52] um that is a very powerful um that's probably

[00:22:56] something that will make it much harder for governments to inflate and debase

[00:22:59] currencies and so if you look at um the information

[00:23:03] revolution over the last 30 40 years and inflation Trends

[00:23:07] inflation Trends have been relentlessly going down it is no longer

[00:23:11] possible for people to easily inflate because the money is no longer

[00:23:14] fully trapped people can ship the money very very quickly and even

[00:23:18] the US which is probably structurally the most inflationary country

[00:23:22] of the major countries left uh cannot unilaterally

[00:23:25] inflate its money anymore 197 August 197 John Connelly

[00:23:29] the treasury secretary could go on TV and say it's to the whole world it's our

[00:23:33] money and it's your problem when they devalue the Dollar by 40%

[00:23:37] that doesn't work anymore can't do that and so I think

[00:23:41] I think there are ways in which um these sorts of

[00:23:45] abilities to to shift things around have have pushed

[00:23:48] it into a much less inflationary world than it uh than it used to be

[00:23:52] which means that uh governments have correspondingly less

[00:23:56] power to uh to weaken um the currencies which is one of the

[00:23:59] main ways governments have historically confiscated and taxed money

[00:24:03] empirically there's a lot less of it that's H than happened 20 30 years

[00:24:08] ago uh let's see a lot of questions um go ahead

[00:24:12] uh given ma believe that technological progress com from ideas

[00:24:16] having SE question maty's

[00:24:20] idea technological development is a result of ideas

[00:24:23] having sex um when do you see the ID

[00:24:27] intellectual property law as a force against

[00:24:31] the development of Technology progress that patents and C instead

[00:24:35] of a positive or negative in technological

[00:24:39] progress uh I think I think that

[00:24:43] as currently constituted um patent and IP

[00:24:47] laws are a big negative I I don't I don't

[00:24:50] know if there can't be some version of them that works but certainly

[00:24:54] in a technological context uh it is uh

[00:24:57] it's B basically uh you have an incredibly bogus patent

[00:25:01] office where you can file all sorts of crazy patents that don't make

[00:25:05] sense and it's just it really gloms up the system

[00:25:09] tremendously uh I do think you want to have something where

[00:25:13] the inventors of things you know are rewarded

[00:25:17] for it and where it can't be um can't be stolen um

[00:25:21] but uh the way I think about it as a as a as an investor

[00:25:24] is and venture capitalist and entrepreneur is that uh we have to

[00:25:28] invest in companies where people in a sense figure out some

[00:25:31] some quasi self- enforcing things where there's something about

[00:25:35] the intellectual property that makes it hard to be stolen uh because

[00:25:39] I don't think we can actually count on the government to protect us so I think the

[00:25:42] reality is we do not have a functioning intellectual property regime we

[00:25:46] might be able to have one and maybe it's just a function of a non-functioning

[00:25:50] government and maybe that's a function of the fact government never works but uh

[00:25:54] I think we should be aware of that and just uh just figure out what you

[00:25:57] can do where inventors get rewarded and where it's it's

[00:26:01] in effect self- enforcing uh

[00:26:05] let's see yes go ahead my name is Alison M

[00:26:09] for Liberty if you were to change one government policy to promote

[00:26:13] private te whaty

[00:26:18] that well there's so many I would I would like to change um

[00:26:22] I think you know I think the one that I am most tempted

[00:26:26] to change if I could just change one it would be

[00:26:30] to remove all restrictions on people leaving

[00:26:34] and so um basically allow

[00:26:37] immigration with no restriction no hindrance this is

[00:26:41] um you know if people could just leave a it's it's

[00:26:45] actually quite hard at this point to leave the US without paying massive penalties

[00:26:49] we're not at the East Germany phase but but we you basically

[00:26:53] want to have people be able to have the freedom to leave and if they have the freedom

[00:26:56] to leave I think um I think that that puts a lot of pressure on

[00:27:00] I think on a state-by-state level for example in the US I'm

[00:27:04] actually quite optimistic the taxes will not go up in California or

[00:27:08] New York or any of these places because too many people can leave and move

[00:27:11] to other states the us as a whole I don't want to leave

[00:27:15] I don't want to leave the US I don't want to leave California but uh if there are

[00:27:18] some other people who do leave um I think that will um that will actually

[00:27:22] uh help apply pressure on making the system even better for um those of us who

[00:27:26] choose to stay and I want them to have the freedom

[00:27:30] believe yes going back a little bit to the U

[00:27:33] to the question about

[00:27:42] um

[00:27:47] woulds don't have to system

[00:27:51] or device you got or or something in the way you use it

[00:27:55] or something that actually do with check the life

[00:27:59] of pattern to some extent what would be an example of something like that

[00:28:03] well you know the really successful internet businesses have typically

[00:28:07] been things where um it's grown so quickly that no

[00:28:10] one can catch so you have the idea it grows so quickly then you have a scalable

[00:28:14] business and you have you sort of it sort of becomes protected through having

[00:28:17] economies of scale there may be secret processes you don't

[00:28:21] tell people about um there may be uh software that

[00:28:25] you uh that you store on a on a server and you don't actually share the code

[00:28:29] so I think that's like one of the ways in which the internet effectively helps people

[00:28:32] protect their intellectual property I just think you can't actually count on the government

[00:28:36] to do it so I think that's just the that's just the negative fact

[00:28:40] it may be we may lament it we may you know but it's just

[00:28:43] we living in a world where intellectual property is mainly used for

[00:28:49] Mischief uh let's see yes

[00:28:54] thank you for your my name is

[00:28:57] and my question is what do you think about the

[00:29:01] concept what do I think about the concept of the singularity

[00:29:05] I think um I think that uh I think

[00:29:09] it would be a good thing if it happened but I think it's an open question whether

[00:29:12] it is going to happen so I think that uh you know um

[00:29:16] the way people normally talk about accelerating technology

[00:29:20] is we need to be scared of it there all these things that can go wrong you know it's like

[00:29:24] what happens if you there sort of all these scarce stories about tech technology

[00:29:29] I think the thing that's really scary is if it doesn't happen and it's because

[00:29:32] if it if it does not happen um we will have

[00:29:36] you know incredible resource scarcity you will have incredible

[00:29:40] issues of uh of a retirement system that's broken and underfunded

[00:29:44] on and on down the line so um so I certainly hope that

[00:29:48] it's going to happen I think that if there was no politics in our world

[00:29:51] it would be happening at a fast enough rate that we could

[00:29:55] sort of solve a lot of the problems we have um

[00:29:59] and we basically have uh we basically have this this race between

[00:30:03] uh politics and technology and I think the the debates about the singularity

[00:30:06] or symptomatic of it I think one of the things that's culturally very odd in our society

[00:30:10] is that everybody is against technology almost and it's

[00:30:14] basically and if you think about science fiction as a genre you know

[00:30:17] Star Trek was optimistic one was the last really optimistic

[00:30:21] Sci-Fi movies since Star Trek maybe the Star Trek repeats but most of them are about

[00:30:25] technology that doesn't work or technology that's bad

[00:30:29] um and so you know I think science fiction as a genre has sort of collapsed in

[00:30:32] the last you know 50 60s we don't really believe it anymore

[00:30:37] um and I think that's really unfortunate because

[00:30:40] that is sort of an important part of the way

[00:30:44] out yeah the point I'd like to make following on to that is the

[00:30:47] fact that right now governments are sucking up all the resources

[00:30:51] that could be used to develop this technology that's going to

[00:30:56] make the world it's a complete misallocation

[00:30:59] of resources yes I I don't yes yes

[00:31:04] okay go ahead do you think that a free market worldwide

[00:31:08] currency would be necessarily based on precious metals or

[00:31:11] is there a future for digital Anonymous

[00:31:17] cash you know I think I think currency is always a very

[00:31:21] you know very mysterious sort of a thing um

[00:31:24] you know my standard uh prop when I was um when I was

[00:31:28] uh running PayPal was to sort of

[00:31:32] always just um you

[00:31:35] know hold up a $100 bill and

[00:31:39] you know you ask people it's always a great way to get people's attention

[00:31:43] you actually if you if you ever need to give a talk and give people's attention start

[00:31:46] by waving money it's hypnotic and and you know

[00:31:50] and This Is Not Gold it's not really based on gold it's not

[00:31:54] clear it has any use value I mean you wouldn't even want to use this as

[00:31:57] toilet paper right or as wallpaper or anything like that

[00:32:01] so it has no intrinsic value and then it's just this weird social

[00:32:05] phenomenon and so you know would you like to have the $100 bill

[00:32:09] uh and why so and you ask you know why does how does money

[00:32:13] work why does it work it's a very very weird thing um

[00:32:16] I think you know I think the argument in favor of

[00:32:20] gold and precious metals are that uh are that the government

[00:32:24] can't inflate them the argument against it is it has it

[00:32:28] also has no obvious intrinsic value and there's something you know very weird

[00:32:31] about you know what's the intrinsic value of gold um you know in theory

[00:32:35] I think um you'd want the money to correspond to

[00:32:39] things that are actual productive resources so it would be something like you

[00:32:42] know maybe like a a worldwide Equity Market or

[00:32:46] worldwide Equity index or some something like that would seem to me be the most

[00:32:50] theoretically sound but um but money is a very strange thing

[00:32:53] and we could yeah the same reason and and actually figuring out

[00:32:57] what it how it works exactly would probably take us at least a few

[00:33:01] years or so of discussion go

[00:33:05] ahead to thank

[00:33:09] you think an important

[00:33:13] and um I was curious if you could talk a little bit about

[00:33:17] how you perhaps I don't know if you look for other ideas

[00:33:22] or what do effectively

[00:33:26] how you go identifying potential

[00:33:30] projects or things that you think would be wor

[00:33:34] inv um well let's see

[00:33:38] I we basically we look at um anything

[00:33:42] that's uh that we think makes a difference in the long term

[00:33:46] and that uh that's underfunded that's the basic

[00:33:50] those are the basic uh the Bas the general criteria so basically

[00:33:54] the things that are um the things that are um

[00:33:57] things that are underfunded um short-term things I think

[00:34:01] tend to be taken care of by the free market system

[00:34:05] um and then uh or you know by various other existing Charities

[00:34:09] I think it's the long-term stuff that people aren't thinking about nearly enough

[00:34:12] and uh and so we're very interested in what we can do to help encourage

[00:34:16] technology one of the initiatives uh that uh we

[00:34:20] just uh we just uh started a few weeks ago I will just uh

[00:34:23] self-promotion advertisement intermission here is uh we

[00:34:27] decided um that we need to do something to encourage more people

[00:34:31] to go into technology and uh and there is

[00:34:34] actually I think a very deep problem where our education system

[00:34:38] is actually become inimical to technological progress and

[00:34:42] uh the basic uh there's sort of a lot of reasons I can go through with this but

[00:34:46] basically uh public education University education

[00:34:49] basically is education to get people tracked to think

[00:34:53] the same way to do the same things really great companies are getting

[00:34:57] started by people who actually often drop

[00:35:00] out of college or stop out of college and uh and

[00:35:04] we basically have started this Initiative for uh 20

[00:35:07] people under 20 years old will pay them $100,000

[00:35:11] over two years they have to have some idea if they don't have an idea

[00:35:15] we will we will help uh get get them something to do

[00:35:18] but basically we want them to stop out of college for two years

[00:35:22] and actually do something productive um you know

[00:35:26] the um the uh the sort of the um

[00:35:30] the the sort of more the slightly neutral version of this I give in a

[00:35:34] less libertarian context would be that uh that uh

[00:35:38] if you think of debt and leverage as a bad thing and

[00:35:41] that over excessive indebtedness is a problem there's a way

[00:35:45] in which college education has become an exercise in

[00:35:48] massive debt and the college administrators if you complain

[00:35:52] about subprime mortgage brokers who sort of were um telling

[00:35:56] people that they should borrow tons of money to invest in a house

[00:36:00] which may not have been a good investment um uh and you think that

[00:36:03] should be regulated by the government uh the government should start by um

[00:36:07] by uh shutting down the um all the universities where

[00:36:11] the administrators are telling uh students that they should be borrowing

[00:36:14] insane amounts of money to invest in their future it's not an investment

[00:36:18] decision it's actually just a bad consumption decision most colleges are four-year

[00:36:22] parties it's not an investment um and uh

[00:36:26] it's basically uh it's worse it's worse than spending the money

[00:36:29] on a subprime mortgage because at least the house price

[00:36:33] there's a spot price in houses so you can actually figure out how bad it

[00:36:36] is pretty quickly there's no spot price in a college education you don't really

[00:36:40] know what your college is worth till 20 30 years later and so there

[00:36:44] are all sorts of ways in which there's no accountability or anything

[00:36:47] anything like that so I think if we're worried about bubbles

[00:36:51] um you want to be worried about education second second version of this um last

[00:36:54] thought on this is if you Define technology is doing more

[00:36:58] with less very basic definition of Technology um

[00:37:01] the things that are most anti-technological are the ones where we're doing less

[00:37:05] with more or doing the same with a lot more

[00:37:09] and one way to measure what are the most anti-technological sectors

[00:37:13] of our society they're the ones where we've had the most inflation so

[00:37:16] it's you know and and it turns out they're all the ones that are basically government

[00:37:20] run and that's Healthcare the military and education

[00:37:24] and education is actually on an inflation basis probably the wor worst

[00:37:28] it's the most anti-technological sector of our society if you define Technologies

[00:37:32] doing more with less

[00:37:35] yes uh if if technology is going to outpace government

[00:37:39] what do you see as some of the most important uh developments for the future technological

[00:37:43] developments to enable people to uh share information as

[00:37:47] well as perhaps goods and services uh without being able to be

[00:37:50] stopped by a govern

[00:37:54] you know it's it's um it's it's somewhat hard you know I don't think it's

[00:37:58] um necessarily something where you can just be sort of super

[00:38:01] dogmatic and these are the the kinds of things that uh that should be done

[00:38:05] I do think uh I I do think it's

[00:38:09] I think there's some somewhat of a decentralized organic thing where it is you know our

[00:38:13] a big part of our job is just to encourage people who have really inspired ideas

[00:38:16] to do it I tend to think uh you'd like to have ideas that are actually

[00:38:20] big not just small incremental ones so we are very interested

[00:38:24] in ideas that are really going to change the world um

[00:38:27] I I I certainly think you know the information revolution has has played

[00:38:31] an incredibly important role I think on the whole it's been a positive

[00:38:35] even though you know there are certainly you know some worrying Dimensions

[00:38:39] to one can point to uh I you know personally

[00:38:42] I think um you know I I I think biomedical advances

[00:38:46] uh if you could really roll back uh aging would be incredibly

[00:38:50] powerful you know in a world where um in a world where

[00:38:54] everybody dies um it only becomes a question of how

[00:38:57] you die do you die heroically in a war or do you just

[00:39:01] die of old age inity but if if

[00:39:05] death itself is um not just a fact but

[00:39:08] becomes a problem and it's a problem that's being solved I think

[00:39:12] there are sort of all these ideologies around rationalizing

[00:39:16] death justifying death enabling death that uh that

[00:39:19] become much less tenable so I I think that uh I think uh

[00:39:23] transformative biomedical uh progress is

[00:39:26] the area that should by All rights be happening given the sort of progress

[00:39:30] and scientific knowledge that's happening in in biology it seems to

[00:39:34] be happening more slowly um and I think that's I think there is

[00:39:37] a real regulatory problem with that

[00:39:41] yeah given that achieving a Libertarian Society through the political

[00:39:45] process is impossible and the only way to achieve libertarian

[00:39:49] Society is through Market means um what if you

[00:39:53] start over in a new country some African country with a

[00:39:58] and bu that bu it from the ground out

[00:40:02] we've looked at this uh We've looked at all these possibilities um

[00:40:05] I I think um I think the um

[00:40:09] you know I think the basic challenges are that uh

[00:40:13] number one um you have to actually get it's not

[00:40:16] that easy to get the country uh you might have it's your you

[00:40:20] you might not want to be stuck with the people you already have um

[00:40:24] and then um and then actually you know the basic infrastructure may actually cost

[00:40:27] quite a bit more and so I tend to think

[00:40:31] um instead of trying to spend billions or tens

[00:40:35] of billions of dollars building you know um you

[00:40:38] know trying to build a new country you want to do something that works much more

[00:40:42] incrementally and organically where it works on a modest scale

[00:40:46] and then you can sort of scale it from there and so you know on the

[00:40:49] SE steing side we're very interested in any business

[00:40:53] plans of what can you do that would be profitable

[00:40:57] like right now on a sead and we want to get

[00:41:00] things that are incrementally feasible rather than you know

[00:41:04] generally something costs you know on on the Venture Capital side I like to say you know we invest

[00:41:08] in things that cost more than a million dollars because like less than a million

[00:41:12] it's just they too many people that can do it but less than a billion more than a million

[00:41:16] less than a billion that's we like

[00:41:19] ideas in that that's the other caveat on our idea

[00:41:23] range or you could just move to New Hampshire

[00:41:27] yeah Collective action problem there but yes yeah go ahead yeah talking

[00:41:31] about technology government

[00:41:34] I mean I don't know if it will or it won't but I know government sees technology as a

[00:41:38] threat and it's government going a paradigm Shi at least

[00:41:42] in the F I'm in of what they're trying to do which reminds me

[00:41:45] of what they did in the political sense when it was difficult to

[00:41:49] keep people in a condition of slavery when they knew that they were slaves

[00:41:52] so you change that to democracy where people are pulled believing

[00:41:57] slav and what they're doing at least in my field with technology it's kind of

[00:42:01] like what you're doing offering money up to people in technology to do that

[00:42:05] think there used to be a there still is a a meeting of all the

[00:42:09] hackers in the world now governments are partnering with these hackers that used to

[00:42:12] meet in covert means to stay away from it so now government

[00:42:16] is partnering and bringing them in so instead of this covert

[00:42:19] subversion that government used to do into these groups now it's like

[00:42:23] over part partnering and also rewarding

[00:42:34] reallyy question well I

[00:42:38] I I do think um you know look

[00:42:42] I my my caveat on the political thing is we may it

[00:42:45] may be utopian to get rid of government or politics

[00:42:49] altogether um you know to the extent people have

[00:42:53] to be entangled with it you should be entangled as little as possible though and so

[00:42:56] you should you know never forget that it is that there

[00:43:00] is something deeply deeply wrong about we at least

[00:43:04] you know never lose sight of that fact

[00:43:08] yes go ahead um you mentioned Star Trek as being

[00:43:11] the last optimistic show a science fiction genre

[00:43:15] do you think that that's symptomatic of our attitude to technology

[00:43:18] or do you think that um are the movies we see and the shows

[00:43:22] we see can actually change the way we think about technology

[00:43:27] um let's say I think I think I'm sort of sorry at low on time here

[00:43:31] but I'll just answer that that question um I think

[00:43:35] that uh I think it's more just a symptom of how

[00:43:39] we're in a society that's taking less and less of its

[00:43:42] bearings from scientific and technological progress

[00:43:46] and it's not the most important symptom um but

[00:43:50] certainly uh whenever there's a government push for regulating technology

[00:43:54] more it's not something that's on the top 10 list of things people

[00:43:57] worry about um and um and that's

[00:44:01] I'd say so you know if if if you know if if

[00:44:04] the number one thing people were telling um

[00:44:08] the political leaders is you know we want you to

[00:44:12] get rid of government regulation of Technology you know allow

[00:44:15] us to build you know you know nuclear power

[00:44:19] allow us to you know go into space have supersonic

[00:44:23] planes again allow us to um get rid of the FDA allow us

[00:44:27] have any drugs we would like um you know maybe we could

[00:44:30] actually move forward on some of those issues maybe not but it's not even

[00:44:34] it's not even like in the top 10 list and I think that's that's unfortunate because I

[00:44:37] think I think it is actually one of the most important if not the most

[00:44:41] important uh dimension on which uh which

[00:44:45] a lot of these questions will be

[00:44:48] decided cool uh can I do one more question

[00:44:52] or all right go ahead one more

[00:45:03] how um just go go ahead and 2020.org

[00:45:07] just go ahead and apply

[00:45:11] all right thanks a lot
