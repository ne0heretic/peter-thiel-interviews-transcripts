[Peter Thiel on "The Portal", Episode #001: "An Era of Stagnation & Universal Institutional Failure."](https://youtu.be/nM9f0W2KD5s)

[00:00:01] [Music]

[00:00:08] hello and welcome to the portals first episode today

[00:00:12] I'll be sitting down with Peter teal now if you've been following

[00:00:16] me on Twitter or perhaps as a podcast guest on other podcasts

[00:00:19] you may know that I work for teal capital but one of the things

[00:00:23] that people ask me most frequently is given that you are so

[00:00:27] different than your boss and friend Peter teal how is it the two of

[00:00:30] you get along what is it that you talk about where do you agree in disagree now

[00:00:34] oddly Peter and I both do a fair amount of public speaking

[00:00:38] but I don't believe that we've ever appeared in public together and very

[00:00:41] few people have heard our conversations what's more he almost never

[00:00:45] mentions me and I almost never mentioned him in our public lives

[00:00:48] so hopefully this podcast will give some

[00:00:52] indication of what a conversation is like is somebody who I find

[00:00:56] one of the most interesting and influential teachers of our time

[00:01:00] somebody who has influenced all sorts of people in Silicon Valley involved

[00:01:04] with technology and inventing tomorrow and who is often not seen

[00:01:08] accurately in my opinion by the commentariat and the regular

[00:01:12] people who a pine as pundits in the world of science and technology

[00:01:15] I hope you'll find Peter as fascinating as I do without

[00:01:19] further ado this is the first episode of the portal thanks

[00:01:23] for joining hello

[00:01:26] and welcome you found the portal I'm your host Eric Weinstein and I think

[00:01:30] this is our first interview show to debut and I'm here with my good

[00:01:34] friend and employer mr. Peter Tila Peter welcome to the portal well Eric thanks

[00:01:37] for having me on your program know this is a great honor one of the things I think is kind

[00:01:41] of odd is is that lots of people know that I work

[00:01:45] for you and many people know that we're friends but even

[00:01:48] though we both do a fair amount of public speaking I don't think we've ever appeared

[00:01:52] anyplace in public together is that your recollection as well I I

[00:01:56] can't think of a single occasion so this proves were not the same person we're not the

[00:01:59] same person you were not my alter ego but you know on that front

[00:02:03] I think it is kind of an odd thing for me I mean we met

[00:02:07] each other I think when I was in my late 40s and if

[00:02:11] you'd ever told me that the person who would be most likely

[00:02:14] to complete my thoughts accurately would be you I never would

[00:02:18] have believed it never having met you we have somewhat opposite politics

[00:02:21] we have very different life histories how do

[00:02:25] you think it is that we've come to share

[00:02:28] such a lot of thinking I mean I have to say that

[00:02:32] a lot of my ideas are cross pollinated with yours so you occur in a lot

[00:02:35] of my my standard riffs how do you think

[00:02:39] that is that we came to different conclusions but share so much of

[00:02:42] a body of thought it's um I'm

[00:02:46] always hard-pressed to answer that since the conclusions all seem correct to me so

[00:02:50] you know it's uh and it's always mysterious why

[00:02:54] why we right it feels like we're the outliers and

[00:02:58] we're the only or among the very few people that reach some of these conclusions

[00:03:01] about sort of the relative stagnation and science and technology

[00:03:05] the ways in which this is arranging our culture our politics

[00:03:09] our society and then how we need to try to find some

[00:03:13] some bold ways out some bold ways to find a new portal

[00:03:17] to different a different world and and

[00:03:21] I think there's sort of different ways the two of us came at

[00:03:24] this I feel like you got you got to some of these um perspectives

[00:03:28] at a very early point sort of the mid-1980s that

[00:03:32] something was incredibly off I probably got there in

[00:03:35] the early mid 90s when I was from this tract law

[00:03:39] firm job in New York City and somehow everything

[00:03:43] felt like it was more like a Ponzi scheme it wasn't really going

[00:03:47] towards the future everyone had promised you and in the sort of elite you

[00:03:50] know undergraduate in law school education I had gone through and

[00:03:54] so yes I think I think we're sort of point we we got to these insights

[00:03:57] but it's it's still striking how um you

[00:04:02] know how how out of sync they feel with with so

[00:04:05] much of our society even even in 2019 yeah I mean it's a very striking

[00:04:09] thing for me and it's also something that's frustrated me sometimes

[00:04:13] when I look forward to you being interviewed is that it often feels to me

[00:04:17] that so much time is spent on the initial question like

[00:04:20] are we somewhat stagnating in science and technology

[00:04:24] that rather than assuming that as a conclusion which I think we can

[00:04:27] make a pretty convincing argument that there has been a lot of stagnation it

[00:04:32] seems to me that a lot of these conversations hang at an earlier level and

[00:04:35] so one of the things that I was hoping to do in this which is I think your

[00:04:39] second long-form podcast you did Dave Rubin show some time

[00:04:43] ago is to sort of presuppose some

[00:04:46] of the basics that people will be familiar with who've been following either one of us

[00:04:50] or both of us and to get to the part of the

[00:04:54] conversation that I think never gets explained

[00:04:57] and discussed because people are always so hung

[00:05:01] up at the initial frame issue so with

[00:05:05] your indulgence let's talk a little bit about

[00:05:09] what you and I see and any

[00:05:13] differences that we might have about this period of time

[00:05:17] that we find ourselves in in 2019 what

[00:05:21] would you say is the dominant

[00:05:24] narrative before we get to what might be our shared

[00:05:28] kind of counter narrative well um

[00:05:31] you know the dominant narrative is probably fraying and it's been fraying

[00:05:35] for some time but it it is something like you know

[00:05:39] we're in a world of generally fast

[00:05:43] scientific and technological progress things

[00:05:46] are getting better all the time there's some imbalances

[00:05:50] that maybe need to be smoothed out there's some corner case problems

[00:05:54] maybe there's some dystopian risks because the technology so

[00:05:57] fast and so scary it might be destructive but it's

[00:06:01] a it's a generally acceleration ax story and then

[00:06:05] there's some sort of micro adjustments within that that that

[00:06:09] one would have to would have to make it is

[00:06:13] there's you know there's sort of are all sorts of ways that I

[00:06:16] think it's fraying you know I think 2008 was a big watershed moment

[00:06:20] but but that's still what's what's largely largely been holding together

[00:06:24] and then you know there's sort of different institutions when

[00:06:27] you look at you can look at the universities where you

[00:06:31] know sort of this attract thing it's costing more every year but it's still worth

[00:06:35] it it's still an investment in the future and and

[00:06:38] this was probably already questionable in the 1980s nineteen in

[00:06:42] college debt in the United States in 2000 was three hundred billion dollars now it's around

[00:06:46] you know 1.6 1.7 trillion and so there's

[00:06:50] a way in which the story was shaky 20 years ago and today

[00:06:53] is is much Shaker it's still sort of holding together somehow so

[00:06:58] in this story in essence the

[00:07:02] great dream is that your children will become educated they

[00:07:05] will receive a college education they will find careers and then in this

[00:07:09] bright and dynamic society they can look forward

[00:07:12] to a future that is brighter than the future that

[00:07:16] previous generations look forward to yes I think now

[00:07:20] again I think I think people are hesitant to actually articulated quite that way because that

[00:07:23] already sounds not quite true to well there's a year to your point they've been adding epicycles

[00:07:27] for some time so so it's maybe it's a bright future

[00:07:31] but it's really different from the parents we can't quite know and they've you

[00:07:34] know they have all these uh these new devices they have an iPhone and they can text really

[00:07:38] fast in the iPhone we can't even understand what the younger generation is doing

[00:07:42] so there's so maybe it's better on it but better has sort of an objective

[00:07:46] scale maybe it's just different and unmeasurable but but

[00:07:49] better in sort of an unmeasurable way so they're sort of our ways it's gotten modified but

[00:07:53] but that would still be you know very powerfully intact narrative

[00:07:57] and then and then that there are sort of

[00:08:00] straightforward things we can be doing the system's basically working and

[00:08:04] it's basically gonna continue to work and there's

[00:08:08] sort of a global version of this there's a US version there's a upper-middle-class

[00:08:12] US version there are a lot of different variations on this so

[00:08:16] it always strikes me that one of the things that you

[00:08:20] do very well is that you're willing and you

[00:08:23] know you're famously a chess player you're willing to make certain sacrifices

[00:08:27] in order to advance a point and in this case I

[00:08:31] think you and I would both agree that there are

[00:08:34] certain areas that have continued to follow the growth

[00:08:38] story more than the general economy

[00:08:42] and that you have to kind of give those stories their due before you

[00:08:45] get to see this new picture where do you think the future has been relatively

[00:08:50] more bright in recent years well

[00:08:53] again I you know I I sort date the this era of stagnate relative

[00:08:57] stagnation and slowed progress all the way back to the 1970 so I think it's been

[00:09:01] close to half a century that we've been in this in this era of

[00:09:05] seriously slowed slowed progress obviously

[00:09:09] a very big exception this has been the world of bits computers

[00:09:13] internet mobile internet software and so

[00:09:17] Silicon Valley has somehow been this up in this dramatic exception

[00:09:21] you know it and where's the world of atoms it

[00:09:25] has been has been much slower for for something like 50 years and

[00:09:29] you know when I was an undergraduate at Stanford in the late 1980s almost

[00:09:33] all engineering disciplines in retrospect were really bad feels to go into

[00:09:36] people already knew at the time you shouldn't go into nuclear engineering aero-astro

[00:09:40] was a bad idea but you know Chemical Engineering mechanical engineering all

[00:09:44] these things were were bad fields computer science was

[00:09:48] that would have been a very good field to go into and and that's

[00:09:52] been sort of a an area where there's been tremendous growth so

[00:09:56] I thought that's that's a that's sort of the the signature one that

[00:09:59] I would I would uh I would cite there questions about

[00:10:03] you know how healthy it is at this point even within that field

[00:10:07] so so you know there's the iPhone is now looking the

[00:10:10] same as it did seven eight years ago so that's the iconic invention

[00:10:14] not quite so sure and so there's been sort of a definitely

[00:10:18] a change in the tone even within Silicon Valley in the last five six

[00:10:21] years on on this but that that had been that had been

[00:10:25] one that was very very decoupled on the decoupling itself

[00:10:28] had had some odd effects where where if

[00:10:32] you have sort of a narrow cone of progress around this world

[00:10:35] of vets then the people who are in the those

[00:10:39] parts of the economy have more to do with atoms will feel like they're being left

[00:10:43] behind so there was something there was something about the tech narrative

[00:10:47] that had this very um didn't necessarily feel

[00:10:51] inclusive didn't feel like like everybody was getting ahead in one

[00:10:54] of the ways I've described it is that we live in a world where I'm

[00:10:58] you know we've been working on the Star Trek computer in Silicon Valley but

[00:11:02] we don't have anything else from Star Trek we don't have the warp drive we

[00:11:05] don't have the transporter can't you know re-engineer in

[00:11:09] sort of this cornucopia world where there's no scarcity and

[00:11:13] and then you know how good is a society where you have a well-functioning

[00:11:17] Star Trek computer but nothing else from Star Trek yeah that's incredibly

[00:11:21] juicy I mean one of the ways that I attempted to encode something which

[00:11:25] in part I got from you was to say of

[00:11:28] course your iPhone is amazing it's all that's left of your once limitless

[00:11:32] future because it's the collision of the communications and the semiconductor

[00:11:37] revolutions that did seem to continue and I I date the

[00:11:40] the sort of break in the economy to something like

[00:11:44] 1972 73 74 it's really quite

[00:11:48] sharp in my mind is it that way in yours yes

[00:11:51] it's it was probably like I'd say 1968

[00:11:55] people still you know the the narrative progress

[00:11:59] seemed intact on 73 it was somehow over so somewhere

[00:12:03] in that in that five year period you know one I mean I've sort

[00:12:06] of had you know the 1969 version was we landed on the moon in July of 1969

[00:12:11] and you know Woodstock starts three weeks later and maybe that's that's

[00:12:14] one way you could describe the cultural shift you can describe it in terms of

[00:12:18] the oil shocks of 1973 at the at the back end there

[00:12:22] probably you know with with the benefit of hindsight the were things are already

[00:12:26] framed by the late 1960s so the environment was getting dramatically

[00:12:29] worse you have the right the Graduate movies you should go into plastics I

[00:12:33] think it was 1968 or 69 and that would have you know that

[00:12:37] would have um so there were sort of things were where the

[00:12:40] story was fraying but but I think was still broadly intact in 1968

[00:12:44] and somehow seemed very off by 73 now

[00:12:48] something that actually I'm scanning my memory and I don't know

[00:12:52] that we've had this conversation so I'm curious to hear your answer

[00:12:56] one of the things that I found surprising is that

[00:13:00] I think I can tell a reasonably decent story about

[00:13:04] how this is a result of a scientific problem

[00:13:08] rather than the mismanagement of our future

[00:13:11] do you believe that if we assume that there

[00:13:15] was this early 1970s structural change in the economy

[00:13:19] that it was largely a sort

[00:13:22] of man-made problem which is what we seemingly implicitly always

[00:13:26] assumed or might it be a scientific one

[00:13:30] and let me give you the one exotic example that really kind of drives

[00:13:33] it home for me I think quarks were discovered in 1968

[00:13:37] and to find out that the proton and neutron are

[00:13:41] comprised of up and down quarks is an incredible change

[00:13:45] in our picture of the world yet it has no seeming

[00:13:49] implications for industry and I I

[00:13:52] started thinking about this question are we somehow

[00:13:56] fenced out of whatever technologies are to

[00:14:00] come that we sort of exhausted one orchard of low-hanging fruit and haven't

[00:14:03] gotten to the next yes um yes

[00:14:07] so there's always I think one one one way to parse this question of scientific

[00:14:11] technological stagnation is sort of nature versus

[00:14:15] culture um didn't ate the ideas in nature run out or

[00:14:18] at least the useful ideas maybe we find make some more discoveries but they're not useful or

[00:14:22] the easily useful easily useful it's the sort of nature so

[00:14:26] it's a problem with nature and then the the cultural problem is that

[00:14:29] there was actually a lot to be discovered or a lot that could be made useful but somehow

[00:14:33] the culture had gotten gotten deranged and I sort of

[00:14:37] go back and forth on those two explanations I think it's it's it's it's very complicated

[00:14:41] obviously we had um I think in physics you'd

[00:14:45] say even though you know I mean probably even

[00:14:48] the fundamental discovery stopped after the mid-1970s but but certainly

[00:14:52] the translation didn't happen quarks don't matter for chemistry and chemistry's what

[00:14:56] matters on a you know on a human level I would I would say there

[00:15:00] was a lot that happened in biochemistry so sort of the you know

[00:15:03] not chemistry down to sort of chemistry up the interface between chemistry

[00:15:07] and biology and that's where

[00:15:11] I would be inclined to say there's a lot more that could happen and

[00:15:15] has not quite happened because maybe the problems are hard maybe but

[00:15:19] maybe also the cultural institutions for researching them are a restrictive it's

[00:15:23] too heavily regulated in certain ways and and it's been just

[00:15:27] somewhat slower than one would have expected in the 1970s so maybe

[00:15:30] it's really just a constant dialogue between nature and culture

[00:15:34] yes obviously because obviously if nature has

[00:15:38] stopped then the culture is going to do range so there's a way in which culture

[00:15:42] is linked to nature and then you know the culture deranged is it also will

[00:15:46] look like nature stops so so I think these things are theirs

[00:15:50] they're probably elements of both but I am I am always

[00:15:53] um optimistic in the sense that I think we

[00:15:57] could have done better I think we could do better I think there are you

[00:16:01] know it's not necessarily the case that we can advance on all fronts in every direction but

[00:16:05] I think there there's more space on the frontier than just in

[00:16:09] this world of bits so I think there are various dimensions on

[00:16:12] atoms where we could and we could be advancing and we just we just have chosen

[00:16:16] not to why do you think it's so hard to convince people that

[00:16:20] because both of us have had this experience where

[00:16:24] we sit down let's say to an interview and somebody talks about the dizzying pace of

[00:16:28] change and both you and I see

[00:16:32] almost I mean it's almost objectively true I have this

[00:16:35] test which is going to a room and subtract

[00:16:39] off all of the screens yes how do you know you're not in 1973

[00:16:43] but for issues of design there aren't that many clues yes

[00:16:48] there are well let's you know all sorts of things one can one

[00:16:52] can point to I mean you know I always point to the productivity data and economics

[00:16:55] which aren't great and then you get into debates you know how accurately are those being

[00:16:59] measured you um you have the sort of intergenerational thing where

[00:17:03] you know our generation Gen X is at a tougher time than the

[00:17:06] boomers the Millennials seem to be having a much tougher time then you

[00:17:10] know either us or the boomers had so there seems to be this generational thing

[00:17:14] so there are some of these sort of macroeconomic variables that

[00:17:18] seem that seem pretty off the UM the direct scientific

[00:17:22] questions I think are very hard to get a handle on and the

[00:17:26] reason for this is that in late modernity which

[00:17:29] we're living it on there's simply too much knowledge for

[00:17:33] any individual human to understand all of it and so you

[00:17:37] know and so the the and so in this world of extreme hyper

[00:17:41] specialization where it's narrower narrower subsets

[00:17:45] of experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are this

[00:17:49] theorist talking about how great string theory is the cancer researchers talking about how

[00:17:53] they're just about to cure cancer the quantum computer researchers are just about

[00:17:56] to build you know quantum computer there will be a massive breakthrough and then if

[00:18:00] you're to say that all these fields not much is happening people just don't

[00:18:03] have the authority for this and this is somehow a very different feel for

[00:18:07] science or knowledge than you would have had in 1800

[00:18:12] or even in 1900 in or 1800 Goethe could still understand

[00:18:15] just about everything where 1900 Hilbert could still understand just

[00:18:20] about all of mathematics and and so the sort of um the

[00:18:23] sort of specialization I think has made it a much harder question

[00:18:27] to get a handle on the political cut I have on the specialization

[00:18:31] is always that that if you analyze the politics

[00:18:35] of science the specialization should make you suspicious it should because

[00:18:39] it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on then it's presumably gotten

[00:18:42] easier for people to lie and to exaggerate and then one should be a little

[00:18:46] bit suspicious and that's that's a sort of my starting my starting

[00:18:50] bias well in mind mine as well and I think perhaps

[00:18:54] sort of the craziest idea to come out of all of

[00:18:57] this and again you met your version of this in a

[00:19:01] law firm which is predicated upon the idea that a partner

[00:19:05] would hire associates and the associates would hope to become partners who could then

[00:19:08] hire associates and so that has that pyramidal structure and in

[00:19:12] the university system every professor is trying to Train graduate

[00:19:16] students to become research professors to Train graduate students and I

[00:19:20] think that you know the universities were probably the most aggressive of

[00:19:24] these sort of things I've called embedded growth obligations

[00:19:28] but the implication of this idea that we

[00:19:31] structured almost everything on an expectation of

[00:19:35] growth and then this growth that was expected ran out it

[00:19:39] wasn't as high and as stable and as technologically led as before has

[00:19:43] a pretty surprising implication which is I mean

[00:19:47] let's not dance around it it feels like almost

[00:19:51] universally all of our institutions are now pathological

[00:19:55] or sociopathic or whatever you want to call them yes yes I suppose

[00:19:59] there's sort of two two ways one could imagine going

[00:20:03] you know you had these expectations of great growth

[00:20:06] great expectations he's the Charles Dickens novel from the 19th century when

[00:20:10] I had great expectations and then you can try

[00:20:13] to UM be honest and say the expectations are dialed

[00:20:17] down or you can continue to say everything's great and it

[00:20:21] just happens not to be working out for you but it's working out for people in general and

[00:20:25] and somehow it's been very hard to have

[00:20:28] the sort of honest reset and and and

[00:20:32] the incentives have been for the institutions to drange until I so

[00:20:35] there's a pop there's probably a way the universities could function

[00:20:39] if they did not grow you know you'd be honest most people in PhD

[00:20:43] programs don't become professors maybe you'd make the PhD programs much shorter

[00:20:47] maybe it'd be much more selective you let fewer people and there would

[00:20:50] be some way you could sort of adjust it and the institutions could

[00:20:54] still be much healthier than they are today but that's that's not

[00:20:58] the path that that's seeming that was taken and and you know something

[00:21:02] like this could have been done in the law firm context or maybe maybe um

[00:21:05] you uh you still at the same percentage of people become partner

[00:21:09] but the partners don't get don't make quite as much money as before or

[00:21:13] something like that so that there would have been ways when one could have gone but

[00:21:16] those were generally not the choices that were made yeah I

[00:21:20] wonder if that's even possible because if you had a law firm that was honest or

[00:21:24] a university that was fairly honest and you had one that was dishonest it

[00:21:28] seems to me that the dishonest one could attempt to use

[00:21:32] its prestige to out-compete the honest one and

[00:21:35] so that would become a self-extinguishing strategy

[00:21:39] unless you somehow had like a truth in advertising

[00:21:44] program yeah I I I don't know

[00:21:47] you know I I do think the truth you know when it breaks through you're better

[00:21:51] off having told it than not not having and so it's always it as

[00:21:55] long as everybody was dishonest it could work well

[00:21:58] this and that's but ya know it's look it's it's it's it's mysterious to me how

[00:22:02] long it worked we had you know we had these crazy bubble economies

[00:22:06] in the you know we had the the tech bubble in the 90s the housing bubble

[00:22:09] in the 2000s you know what I think is a government debt bubble

[00:22:13] you know this last decade and so

[00:22:17] if you've had this sort of you know up down bubble that's

[00:22:20] um that's that's sort of harder to see than

[00:22:24] if things were just flat so if the growth in 1970 things

[00:22:28] just flatlined in the end you had 40 years of no growth

[00:22:32] that would have been problematic and you might have noticed

[00:22:35] that very quickly right but you know in a sense simplifying a

[00:22:39] lot you could say we had you know the 70s were down the 80s were

[00:22:42] up the 90s were up the 2000s were down so two down

[00:22:46] two up net flat but it didn't feel that way he's

[00:22:50] like internally there's a lot of excitement a lot of stuff happened and so yeah

[00:22:53] there's in California was like a even more extreme version

[00:22:57] of this you know the last you know the last three recessions in California

[00:23:01] were much more severe than in the country as a whole the recoveries were steeper

[00:23:04] and so California's felt incredibly volatile

[00:23:08] the volatility gets interpreted as dynamism and then

[00:23:12] and then people and then before you know it 30 or 40

[00:23:16] years have passed one thing that I I'm very

[00:23:19] curious about is how this discipline

[00:23:23] seems to have arisen where almost everyone representing

[00:23:27] the institutions who tell some version of this universal

[00:23:31] story which I'll be honest to my

[00:23:34] way of thinking can be instantly invalidated by anyone

[00:23:38] who chooses to do so it's just that the cost of invalidating it is quite

[00:23:42] high you know Paul Krugman wrote this

[00:23:45] column called a protectionist moment mmm-hmm where he said

[00:23:49] let's be honest the financial

[00:23:53] elites case forever freer trade has always been something of a scam

[00:23:56] and so you had people who were participating

[00:24:00] in this who seemed to have known all along that there's

[00:24:04] no way of justifying this on paper but yet were

[00:24:08] willing and able to participate with seemingly very few consequences

[00:24:12] to their careers like it didn't give opportunities to people

[00:24:16] who were heterodox and saying hey aside

[00:24:19] from a few bright spots more or less we've actually entered a period

[00:24:23] of relative stagnation how did this how did this happen I how

[00:24:26] is it that this he feels so well the individual incentives

[00:24:30] were very different from the collective inside the collective incentive

[00:24:34] we should have not honest conversation and right level set things and get get

[00:24:38] back to a better place I think the individual incentives were often you pretend

[00:24:42] that it's working great for you it's like if you're you know the twenty thousand people here

[00:24:45] who moved to Los Angeles to become movie stars about twenty of them make it and

[00:24:49] so you could say well it's been really hard nobody wants to hire me this is a terrible city

[00:24:52] or you could say you know this has been wonderful that all the doors

[00:24:56] are being opened to me and that's the second one is more fictional

[00:25:00] but that's that's the that's sort of the thing you're supposed to say if

[00:25:03] you're if you're succeeding and there's I think there's a way this is how we've been talking about globalization

[00:25:07] where it's sort of a glib globalization it's working great for

[00:25:11] me and and I'd like to have more people um more talented

[00:25:15] people come to the US I'm not scared of competing with them and an

[00:25:18] on and on so this sort of is is this um yeah

[00:25:22] this or academia if you're you know if you're a professor in academia so

[00:25:25] the tenure system is great it's just picking the most talented people I

[00:25:29] don't think it's that hard at all it's it's completely meritocratic and if

[00:25:33] you don't say those things well we know you're not the person to get tenure yeah

[00:25:37] it's so I think so I think there is sort of this individual

[00:25:40] incentive where um you're supposed if you

[00:25:44] if you pretend the system's working you're simultaneously

[00:25:48] signalling that you're one of the few people who should succeed in it so

[00:25:52] one image that I have in a you know you and I have talked I use

[00:25:56] the word kayfabe for the system of nonsense that

[00:26:01] undergirds professional wrestling and you you've taken to using LARPing

[00:26:05] a live-action role-playing it strikes me

[00:26:08] that we have two

[00:26:12] separate parallel systems now this podcasting experiment

[00:26:16] that you and I are now part of provides

[00:26:20] for a very unscripted out-of-control narrative

[00:26:24] and then there's this parallel institutional narrative that seems

[00:26:27] to exist in a gated form where the institutions keep talking to

[00:26:31] each other and ignore this thing that's happening that

[00:26:35] has reached more and more people so that you effectively

[00:26:39] have multiple narratives one of which I

[00:26:42] think almost no one needs to believe it's just that the institutions

[00:26:46] need to trade kind of lies and deceptions back and forth

[00:26:50] amongst themselves how is it that these two things can be kept separate

[00:26:54] it's like a real wrestling league and a professional wrestling league

[00:26:58] side by side where somehow they just don't come into

[00:27:01] contact with each other well I um well

[00:27:05] I think if they came into contact something they could then they

[00:27:09] wouldn't both be able to exist so I think that's not surprising that they can't cut contact

[00:27:12] I I don't think it's a terribly you know I

[00:27:16] don't think it's alt ultimately stable so I think ultimately you

[00:27:20] know our account is going to prevail on the

[00:27:24] institutional account is so incorrect that it will ultimately fail I've

[00:27:29] probably been more hopeful about how quickly truth prevails

[00:27:32] then it has but in forever I would still I would

[00:27:36] still be very hopeful that that that our account is really gonna break through

[00:27:39] and you know in the next few years I've been talking about the this the

[00:27:43] the tech stagnation problem for for you know the

[00:27:47] better part of a decade and I think when I was talking about this in 2008

[00:27:51] 2009 2010 this was still you know a frenzied

[00:27:55] view it was very fringy within Silicon Valley and I

[00:27:58] think even within Silicon Valley there's sort of a lot of people who've

[00:28:02] come around to it who have partially come around to it there's

[00:28:06] a sense the tech has a bad conscience it feels like it's not in delivering

[00:28:10] the promises you know Google had this propaganda

[00:28:14] about the future and it's now seen as you know the self-driving cars are further away

[00:28:17] than people expected and so I think I think there is sort of a sense that things

[00:28:22] have shifted a lot over the last decade but even like five years

[00:28:25] ago I mean if it feels to me I I moved out

[00:28:29] to work with you in 2013 I'd never

[00:28:32] seen a boom before I mean this was one of the things that was really important to me is that being

[00:28:36] in academics the Academy had been

[00:28:40] in a depression since this change around

[00:28:44] 1970 to 73 and seeing a boom

[00:28:47] and seeing people with like flowers and dollar signs

[00:28:51] in their eyes you know talking about a world of abundance and

[00:28:55] how everything was gonna be great it seemed like everybody was the CEO or CTO

[00:28:59] of some tiny company and then very

[00:29:03] very quickly it all started to change it I felt

[00:29:07] like a lot of people moved back into the behemoths from

[00:29:10] their little startup having failed a lot of the ideology felt

[00:29:14] poisonous like don't be evil was not even something you could utter without

[00:29:18] somebody snickering behind your back there's like a self-hating component where the

[00:29:22] engineers have been recruited ideologically and are like

[00:29:26] not actually there to do business how did this happen so quickly well

[00:29:30] that's always its am I wrong about that no it's it's striking how fast it's

[00:29:34] happened it's striking how much it's happened in the

[00:29:37] context of a bull market so if you describe this in terms of psychology

[00:29:41] you'd think that people people be as angry in

[00:29:45] Silicon Valley as they are today the stock market must be

[00:29:48] down 40 or 50 percent it's like you know people in New York City were angry

[00:29:52] in 2009 they were angry at the bank's they hated themselves but

[00:29:56] you know the stock market was down 50 60 percent the banks had

[00:29:59] gotten obliterated and that sort of makes sense psychologically

[00:30:03] and and the strange thing is that on a in

[00:30:07] terms of the serve law the macroeconomic indicators the stock markets the

[00:30:11] valuations of the larger companies it's it's like way beyond

[00:30:15] the dot-com peaks of 2000 and in

[00:30:18] all sorts of ways but the mood is not like late 99

[00:30:22] early 2000 it has this very different mood and and

[00:30:26] the way I would would explain this is that for

[00:30:29] the people involved it is sort of a look ahead function so it is you

[00:30:33] know um yes this is where where things are but are they gonna be worth a

[00:30:36] lot more in five years ten years and that's gotten that's

[00:30:40] gotten a lot harder to tell and so there's been

[00:30:43] growth but people are unhappy and frustrated because they

[00:30:47] don't see that much growth going forward even within tech even

[00:30:51] within this world of of bets which had been you know very very decoupled

[00:30:55] for for such a long time now one

[00:30:59] of the things that's interesting to me is is that when we talk like

[00:31:02] this a lot of people are gonna say wow that's a lot of gloom and doom so

[00:31:06] much is changing so much is and

[00:31:10] yet what I sense is is that both you and I have

[00:31:13] an idea that we've lived our entire life in

[00:31:17] some sort of intellectual Truman Show where everything

[00:31:22] is kind of fake and something super exciting is

[00:31:26] about to happen do you share it my is that a fair

[00:31:29] telling that well I think that I think

[00:31:33] there's been the potential to get back to the future for

[00:31:37] a long time and you're there there have been breaks in this Truman Show at

[00:31:41] various points there was a big break with 9/11 there was a big break

[00:31:45] with the 2080 browsers um you know

[00:31:48] you could say there's some sort of break with Trebek Siddhant Trump and

[00:31:52] in the last few years it's still like a little bit undecided with it what

[00:31:55] that all means but I think I think there were a lot

[00:31:59] of reasons to to question this and reassess this for some time

[00:32:03] the three assessments never quite happened but but I would

[00:32:06] say I think we're now at the point where where this is is really gonna

[00:32:10] happen in the next you know um you know two

[00:32:14] years to five years to two decade I don't think The Truman Show can

[00:32:17] keep going keep going that much longer you know when I was you

[00:32:22] know and again I've been wrong about this me too no no I mean I've been very wrong

[00:32:25] I've called it we had a bit an off site when I was running PayPal in spring of 2001

[00:32:29] you know the Nasdaq had gone from 2,000 to 5,000 back to 2000

[00:32:33] um comm bubble was over and I was explaining you know

[00:32:36] we're just battening down the hatches at least one little company has survived we're

[00:32:40] gonna survive and but the ins sort of insanity

[00:32:44] that we saw in the dot-com years will never come back in the lifetimes of the

[00:32:47] people here because you know it's psychologically you can't go that

[00:32:51] crazy again while you're still alive right the 1920s didn't come back till the

[00:32:55] less maybe the 1980s or something long generationally yeah was

[00:32:59] over and yet already in 2001 we had the incipient housing

[00:33:02] bubble and and somehow some other shows

[00:33:06] kept going for for it for 20 years with the narrative

[00:33:10] like the whole narrative behind the Great Moderation I

[00:33:13] mean I remember just like clutching my head how

[00:33:17] can you tell a story that we banished volatility yes

[00:33:21] it's always I always think of the 1990s narrative

[00:33:25] was the new economy and you lied about growth and then

[00:33:29] the 2000s narrative was the

[00:33:32] Great Moderation and you lied about volatility and and

[00:33:36] maybe you know there's sort of the the 2010s

[00:33:40] one is a secular stagnation where you lie about the the

[00:33:43] real interest rates because the other two don't work anymore and sort of a complicated

[00:33:47] way these things connect but but yes new economy

[00:33:51] sounded very bullish in the 90s Great Moderation was

[00:33:55] still a reason belong stocks but it sounds less bullish and then

[00:33:59] secular stagnation in the Larry Summers forms to be specific

[00:34:02] what we're talking about means again that you should be long the stock

[00:34:06] market the stock market's going to keep going up because things are so stagnant

[00:34:10] the real rates will stay low forever so so they are equally

[00:34:13] bullish narratives although they sound less bullish over time so

[00:34:17] that effectively we needed what

[00:34:22] happened with the roaring 20s followed by the depression was

[00:34:26] that there was a general skepticism and here the septa sysm seems to

[00:34:29] be specific to something different in each incarnation that

[00:34:33] view it you keep having bubbles with some lie you have yet to tell

[00:34:37] yes but I think and of course I think the the

[00:34:40] crazy cut on the 20s and 30s was that we

[00:34:44] didn't need to have as big of a crash you could you could have probably done all sorts of intervention

[00:34:48] because the 1930s was still a period

[00:34:52] that was very healthy in terms of background scientific technological

[00:34:56] innovation if we just rattle off what was discovered in the

[00:34:59] 1930s that had real-world practical things was the

[00:35:03] aviation industry got off the ground the talkies the movies got a got

[00:35:07] going you had you had the plastics industry you had the

[00:35:11] you know you had secondary oil recovery you had household

[00:35:15] appliances got developed and an ziyan by 1939

[00:35:19] there were three times as many people who had cars in the US as in 1929 and so

[00:35:23] it was there was this crazy tailwind

[00:35:27] of scientific and technological progress that then somehow got you

[00:35:31] know badly mismanaged financially by you whoever you blame

[00:35:35] the crash on huh and so I think that's that's what actually happened

[00:35:39] in the 30s and then and then we tried to sort of manage

[00:35:42] all these financial indicators much more precisely in

[00:35:46] recent decades even though the tailwind wasn't there at all

[00:35:50] so let me focus you on two subjects that

[00:35:54] are important for trying to figure out the economy

[00:35:57] going forward I'm very fond of

[00:36:01] perhaps over claiming but making

[00:36:05] a strong claim for physics that physics gave us atomic

[00:36:09] devices in a nuclear power an ended World War two to fit

[00:36:13] definitively it gave us the semiconductor

[00:36:16] the world wide web theoretical physicists

[00:36:20] invented molecular biology the communications

[00:36:24] revolution all of these things came out of physics and

[00:36:28] you could make the argument that physics has been really

[00:36:31] underrated as powering the world economy on the other

[00:36:35] hand it's very strange to me that we had the three-dimensional

[00:36:39] structure of DNA and 53 we had the genetic code

[00:36:42] 10 years later and we've had

[00:36:46] very little in the way of let's say gene therapy to

[00:36:50] show for all of our newfound knowledge now I have no doubt that

[00:36:54] we are learning all sorts of new things to your point

[00:36:57] about specialization in biology but the translation

[00:37:01] hasn't been anything like what I would have imagined for

[00:37:05] physics so it feels like somehow we're in a new orchard

[00:37:09] and we're spending a lot of time exploring it but we haven't found the low-hanging fruit

[00:37:13] in biology and we've kind of exhausted the physics

[00:37:17] orchard because what we found is so exotic that it you

[00:37:20] know whether it's two black holes colliding or you know a third

[00:37:24] generation of matter or quark substructure we

[00:37:27] haven't been able to use these things are we somehow between revolutions

[00:37:32] well I think I would say the question of what's going on and but

[00:37:36] I'm I wouldn't bet I wouldn't I'd be pessimistic on

[00:37:40] physics generally so that's sort of B he's my bias on that one

[00:37:44] biology I continue to think we could be doing a

[00:37:47] lot more we be making a lot more progress and you

[00:37:51] know the pessimistic version is that no biology is just semis much harder than physics

[00:37:55] and therefore therefore it's been slower going

[00:37:59] the the more optimistic one is that though the the culture is just

[00:38:02] broken we have we've had very talented people go into physics you go into biology

[00:38:06] if you're if you're less talented you know it's sort of like that you can sort of think

[00:38:09] of it as Darwinian terms you you can think of biology as a selection

[00:38:13] for people with bad math genes and if you're good at math you

[00:38:17] go into physics go to math or physics or at least chemistry and

[00:38:20] and biology we sort of selected for um you know all

[00:38:24] of these people who were somewhat somewhat less talented so that might be

[00:38:28] there might be a cultural explanation for for why it's been been

[00:38:31] slower progress but I mean we had people from physics we had like

[00:38:35] teller and Fineman and Crick there's

[00:38:39] no shortage of I mean you

[00:38:42] know to my earlier point molecular biology anyway was

[00:38:46] really founded by physicists more

[00:38:50] than it more than any other thing I think why

[00:38:53] is it that in an era where physics is

[00:38:57] stagnating we don't see these kind of minds

[00:39:01] like I'm a little skeptical that that theory well III

[00:39:05] I'm not I'm not so sure like if you

[00:39:09] you know if you're a string theory person or even sort

[00:39:12] of an applied experimental physicist I don't

[00:39:16] think you can that easily reboot into biology I mean these the you know

[00:39:19] these disciplines have gotten sort of more um more rigid it's

[00:39:24] it's it's pretty hard to to transfer from one area to another i had you

[00:39:28] know i when i was an undergraduate you still had some you know older professors

[00:39:32] who were polymaths who knew a lot about a lot of different things Rises this

[00:39:35] is I think the way one should really think of you know Watson and Crick or fine

[00:39:39] men or you know or tell her they they you know they they were certainly

[00:39:43] world class and in in their field but also like

[00:39:47] incredible in the water fairly aggressive and and

[00:39:50] and you know the the cultural or institutional rule is no

[00:39:54] polymaths allowed you know you could you can be you

[00:39:58] can be narrowly specialized yeah and if you're interested in other

[00:40:02] things you better keep it to yourself and not tell people because if

[00:40:05] you say that you're in you're interested in computer science and also music

[00:40:09] or studying the hebrew bible wow that's uh that's

[00:40:13] that's just uh that must mean you're just not very serious about computer science well

[00:40:18] so i totally want to riff on on this point because i think you've

[00:40:22] hit the nail on the head to my way of thinking the

[00:40:25] key problem is if you go back to our original contention

[00:40:29] which is is that there is something universally pathological about

[00:40:33] the stories that every institution predicated on growth

[00:40:36] has to tell about itself when things are not growing

[00:40:40] the biggest danger is that somebody smart inside

[00:40:44] of the institution will start questioning things and speaking

[00:40:48] openly and it seems like the blue mouse would

[00:40:51] be the people who could connect the dots and say you

[00:40:55] know there's not that much going on in my department there's not much going on this department over here not that

[00:40:58] much going on in this department over there and those people are very very dangerous you

[00:41:02] know one of my one of my friends uh studied physics at

[00:41:06] stanford in the late 90s um his advisor was this professor

[00:41:10] at stanford bob Laughlin who in the late 90s brilliant

[00:41:14] physics guy late nineties he gets the Nobel Prize in Physics and he

[00:41:18] suffers from the supreme delusion that now that he

[00:41:22] has a Nobel Prize he has total academic freedom and he can do anything

[00:41:26] he wants to and he decided to direct it at you know I mean

[00:41:29] they're all these areas you should probably shouldn't go into each position question

[00:41:33] climate science they're all these things when one should be careful about but he

[00:41:36] went into an area far more dangerous than all of those he was convinced that

[00:41:40] there were all these people in the university who were

[00:41:44] doing fake science for wasting government money on fake research that was was

[00:41:48] not really going anywhere and he started by in investigating other departments

[00:41:52] start with the biology department at Stanford University and you

[00:41:56] can imagine this ended catastrophic Lee for a professor Laughlin

[00:41:59] you know his graduate students couldn't get PhDs he no longer

[00:42:03] got funding Nobel a Peace Prize a certain Nobel

[00:42:06] Prize in Physics no protection whatsoever a Julian

[00:42:10] Schwinger fell out of favor with the physics community

[00:42:14] despite being held in its highest regard and having a Nobel Prize and he

[00:42:17] used the epigram in a book where he wanted

[00:42:21] to redo quantum field theory around something he called source theory he said if you can't

[00:42:24] join him beat him and I think it comes as a shock to all

[00:42:28] of these people that there is no level you can rise to in the field

[00:42:32] that allows you to question the assumptions of

[00:42:36] that field right it's it's like you know you're sort

[00:42:39] of proving yourself you're you know you're getting your PhD or getting

[00:42:43] your tenured position and and and then at some point you think

[00:42:47] you would think that you've proven yourself and you can you can talk

[00:42:50] about the whole and not just the parts but you're never allowed to talk about

[00:42:54] more than the parts you know like the UM the person in the

[00:42:57] university context the core the class of people who are supposed

[00:43:01] to talk about the whole right I would say our university presidents because

[00:43:05] they are presiding over the whole of the university and

[00:43:08] they should be able to speak to what the

[00:43:12] nature of the hole is what sort of progress the hole is

[00:43:15] making is the what is the health of the progress of

[00:43:19] the hole and and you know we we

[00:43:23] don't you know we certainly do not pick university presidents who think critically about

[00:43:27] these these questions at all well I remember

[00:43:31] discussing with a president

[00:43:35] of a very highly regarded University he

[00:43:39] came to me said can you explain how your friend Peter Thiel

[00:43:43] thinks because I just had a conversation with him and I

[00:43:46] could not convince him that the universities were

[00:43:50] doing fantastically in this university in particular

[00:43:54] like how does he come to this conclusion and I

[00:43:57] said well look Peter doesn't

[00:44:01] come you know with a PhD but let me speak to you in your own language

[00:44:05] I started going department by department talking about the problems of stagnation

[00:44:09] it was very clear that there was no

[00:44:12] previous experience with any kind of informed

[00:44:16] person making such an argument I mean this

[00:44:20] was a zero day effort but it's all yeah but it's but you know

[00:44:23] in some sense if you're a president of a university

[00:44:28] you know you you should you probably don't want to talk to people that dangerous

[00:44:32] you want to avoid them and you don't want to have such disruptive thoughts because you

[00:44:35] have to you know convince the government or alumni or whoever to keep donating money that everything's

[00:44:39] everything's wonderful and and great and and

[00:44:43] you know I think one has to go back quite a long time

[00:44:47] to UM to even identify any university

[00:44:51] presidents in the United States who said things that were distinctive

[00:44:54] or interesting or or powerful well you know there was you

[00:44:58] know there was Larry Summers at Harvard you know a decade and a half ago and

[00:45:02] tried to do like the most miniscule critiques imaginable

[00:45:05] and got you know crucified but you know I don't think

[00:45:09] of you know I don't think of summers as a particularly revolutionary thinker

[00:45:13] well he he was possessed of

[00:45:16] an idea that the intellectual elite

[00:45:20] in which he undoubtedly saw himself a part of had

[00:45:24] the right to transgress boundaries and

[00:45:27] and I think what's stunning about this is

[00:45:31] the extent to which this breed of outspoken

[00:45:36] disruptive intellectual has no place left

[00:45:40] inside of this system from which to speak but it's you

[00:45:44] know but there's it's not that surprising like in a healthy system

[00:45:48] you could have wild descent and it's not threatening because everyone

[00:45:52] knows the system is healthy in an unhealthy system the

[00:45:55] descent becomes much more dangerous so so you know this

[00:45:59] is and I think that's it's it's it's not that surprising that

[00:46:02] there's always a one-one riff I have on this is always you

[00:46:07] know if you think of a left-wing person as someone who's

[00:46:10] critical of the structures of our society right there's

[00:46:14] a sense in which we have almost no left-wing professors right in this

[00:46:18] key still is still there as sort

[00:46:21] of a last remnant of some clade yes we're no longer doing

[00:46:26] in the sense of let's say just being critical of the institutions they're part of right

[00:46:29] and there may be some that are you know much older so if you're maybe in

[00:46:33] your 80s we can you know we can pretend to ignore you or you

[00:46:37] know it's just what happens to people in their 80s sure and but but

[00:46:40] I don't I don't see you know younger professors in there say 40s

[00:46:44] who are deeply critical of the of the university structure I

[00:46:48] think it's just it's just not you know you

[00:46:51] can't have that it's like again if you come back to something as um as reductionist

[00:46:56] as the ever-escalating student debt right you know

[00:46:59] the bigger the debt gets you can sort of think what is the 1.6

[00:47:03] trillion what does it pay for and in a sense it pays for 1.6

[00:47:07] trillion dollars worth of lies about how great the system is and so the

[00:47:11] more of the debt goes the crazier the system gets but also

[00:47:14] the more you have to tell the lies and these things sort of go together no it's

[00:47:18] it's not a stable sequence at some rate this breaks

[00:47:22] you know again I would I would bet on you know a decade not a century

[00:47:25] well that this is the fascinating thing you of course famously started

[00:47:30] the teal fellowship as a program which correct

[00:47:34] me if I'm wrong on this 2005 is when student

[00:47:38] debt became non dischargeable in bankruptcy 43

[00:47:42] bankruptcy revision right now that yes is so if you if

[00:47:45] you don't pay off your student loans on when you're 65 the government

[00:47:49] will garnish your social security wages to to pay off your student debt right

[00:47:53] this is this is amazing that this existed in a modern

[00:47:56] society and of course well so let me ask am i

[00:48:00] right that you were attacking what was necessary to

[00:48:04] keep the college mythology going and you were afraid and that

[00:48:09] College might be enervating some of our sort of most

[00:48:12] dynamic minds um

[00:48:16] well I think I think there's a lot of different critiques when you want

[00:48:20] your half of the universities I think the debt one is a is a very simple

[00:48:24] very simple one it's on its it's

[00:48:28] always dangerous to be burdened with

[00:48:31] too much debt it's for does limit your your freedom

[00:48:35] of action and it seems especially pernicious to do this super

[00:48:39] early in your career and so if you if out of the gate you owe $100,000

[00:48:44] and you know it's never clear you can get out of that hole that's

[00:48:48] um that's going to either demotivate you or it's going to push you

[00:48:51] into into maybe you know slightly higher paying very

[00:48:55] uncreated professions of the sort that are

[00:48:59] probably you know less good at moving our whole society forwards and so I I

[00:49:03] think yes I think I think the whole thing is is is extraordinarily

[00:49:06] pernicious so and it's it's it's it

[00:49:10] is it was one of these things where I'm you

[00:49:14] know and I started talking about this back in um back in 2010

[00:49:17] at mm mm um it was already

[00:49:21] it was already like it it was controversial but

[00:49:25] it was not like you know younger people all agreed with me the

[00:49:29] younger people younger they you know and and and it's a decade later it's

[00:49:33] a lot crazier it hasn't you know we haven't yet completely won but

[00:49:36] but I think there are more and more people who agree with us I think

[00:49:40] I think at this point on the Gen X parents

[00:49:44] of college students tend to agree whereas I would say the baby boomer

[00:49:48] parents you know 15 years ago would not have agreed

[00:49:51] the 2008 crisis was a big watershed in this to

[00:49:55] were Aang where um you could say the tracking debt you

[00:49:59] know roughly made sense as long as everything all the track careers

[00:50:03] worked in 2008 really blew up you know consulting banking and

[00:50:07] sort of a number of the more track professions got got blown up and

[00:50:11] so that was kind of a watershed now something that is I

[00:50:15] mean this is incredibly dangerous but

[00:50:19] also therefore quite interesting if you imagine that the baby boomers have

[00:50:23] in some sense in order to keep the structure

[00:50:26] of the university going have loaded it up with administrators have

[00:50:30] hiked the tuition much faster than even medical inflation let alone general

[00:50:34] inflation this becomes a crushing debt problem

[00:50:38] for people who are entering the system I saw a

[00:50:41] recent article that said that the company

[00:50:46] that I think is called seeking arrangements which

[00:50:49] it introduces older men

[00:50:53] and women with money to younger men and women with a need for

[00:50:57] money for some sort of ambiguous hybridised dating

[00:51:01] companionship financial transfer and the

[00:51:05] claim was that lots of students were using this supposed

[00:51:10] sugar daddy Inge and sugar mommy I don't know what the terminology is

[00:51:13] in order to alleviate their debt burden it's

[00:51:17] almost as if the baby boomers in so

[00:51:22] creating a system are subjecting their own children

[00:51:26] to things that are pushing them towards a gray area a few

[00:51:30] clicks before you get to honest prostitution I

[00:51:33] know I okay I don't

[00:51:37] I don't want to impute too much intention ality know how this

[00:51:41] happened you know I think it's what emerged a lot of these it was mostly emergent

[00:51:45] mostly uh mostly these things people you

[00:51:49] know yeah that we had sort of somewhat

[00:51:53] cancerous we don't distinguish real growth from cancerous growth and then you

[00:51:56] know once the cancers for metastasizes at a certain

[00:52:00] size you know you have you sort of somehow try to keep the whole thing going and

[00:52:03] it doesn't make that much that much sense um but

[00:52:08] but yes I look I think I think one of the reasons are one

[00:52:12] of the challenges and right on our side this is people more self-critical

[00:52:15] here on on on this is that the

[00:52:19] question we always are confirmed with well what is the alternative how do you actually

[00:52:22] do something and um and it

[00:52:27] is you know it's not obvious what the individual alternatives

[00:52:30] are on an individual level if you get into a elite

[00:52:34] university it probably still makes sense to go you know probably

[00:52:38] isn't make sense to go to number 100 or something like that that's I think

[00:52:41] but but so there is sort of a way can still work individually

[00:52:45] even if it does not work you know for our country as a whole um

[00:52:49] and and and so there are sort of all these all these challenges in in

[00:52:53] in in an in you know coming up with alternate

[00:52:56] tracks like I think I think in software there's some degree to

[00:53:00] which people are be hired if they're just good at coding and it's not quite

[00:53:03] as critical if they have a computer science degree ok can we do this in other other

[00:53:07] careers other fields on I would ten thing one could

[00:53:11] it's been it's been slow to happen well so you and I have been excited

[00:53:15] about a great number of things that have been taking place outside of

[00:53:19] the institutional system but one of the things that I I'm

[00:53:23] continuing continue to be mystified by is that we are somewhat

[00:53:27] politically divided where you are well known as a conservative and

[00:53:31] I really come from a fairly radical progressive

[00:53:35] streak so we have this common view of a lot

[00:53:38] of the problems but sometimes we come to very different ideas about how those

[00:53:42] problems shouldn't be saw do you want to maybe just try riffing

[00:53:46] or figuring out like assume that we somehow found

[00:53:49] ourselves a position of some some degree of power with an ability to direct

[00:53:53] a little bit more than we have currently what would you do

[00:53:57] to create the preconditions so

[00:54:01] not necessarily picking particular projects but what would

[00:54:04] you try to do to create the preconditions where people are really dreaming about

[00:54:09] futures both at a technological level family formation

[00:54:13] making our civil society healthier what

[00:54:17] where would you where would you start to work first

[00:54:21] well yeah there there's a lot of things that so

[00:54:25] I always I'm always a little bit uncomfortable this sort of question because you can

[00:54:28] talk about me too because um you know I feel like uh you

[00:54:33] know we're not going to be dictators of the United States and then you know all sorts

[00:54:36] of things you could do for your dictators if um but

[00:54:40] but certainly on look I would I would I would I

[00:54:44] would look at the college debt thing very seriously I would say that you

[00:54:48] know it's dischargeable in bankruptcy and if and if and if

[00:54:52] if if people um go

[00:54:56] bankrupt and part of the debt has to be paid for by the university

[00:55:00] that that did it there has to be some sort of local accountability so this would love

[00:55:03] that that would be sort of a more right-wing answer the left-wing answers we

[00:55:07] should know socialize the debt in some ways and the universities should never

[00:55:11] pay for that which would be more the you know Sanders warrant approach but but

[00:55:15] it's but there'll be one version I

[00:55:19] think you know I think there is I

[00:55:24] I think there is you know I think one of the main ways inequality

[00:55:27] has manifested in our society last twenty thirty years I think things more

[00:55:31] stagnation than inequality right but just on the inequality

[00:55:35] side it's it's the runaway housing costs and

[00:55:38] there's a baby boomer version we have super strict zoning laws

[00:55:42] so that the house prices go up and the house is your nest egg it's

[00:55:45] not a place to live it's your nest egg for retirement and I would I

[00:55:49] would try to figure out some ways to dile dile that stuff back

[00:55:53] back massively and and that's probably

[00:55:56] intergenerational transfer where it's bad for the acid prices of

[00:56:00] baby boomer homeowners but better

[00:56:04] for younger people to get started in in sort

[00:56:08] of family formation or I was starting house households what

[00:56:12] do you think about the idea of a CED a college equivalency

[00:56:16] degree where you can prove that you have a

[00:56:19] level of knowledge that would be equivalent let's say to a

[00:56:23] graduating Harvard chemistry major right or a

[00:56:27] fraction thereof where you have the ability to prove

[00:56:31] that through some sort of online delivery mechanism

[00:56:35] you create an I love it yeah I think it's very hard to implement again

[00:56:39] I think I think these things are hard to do well again about great idea there's a possibility of

[00:56:43] we have all these people who have something like Stockholm Syndrome where

[00:56:47] they they you know if you if you if you've got a Harvard

[00:56:51] chemistry degree right and if you suspect that you know actually the

[00:56:55] knowledge could be had by a lot of people and if

[00:56:58] it's just a set of tests you have to pass um that your degree would be a lot

[00:57:02] less special you will resist this very very

[00:57:06] hard you know if you're if you're in an um in

[00:57:09] an HR department or in a company

[00:57:13] hiring people you will want to hire people who

[00:57:17] went to a good college because you went to a good college and

[00:57:20] if we broaden the hiring and so we're gonna hire all sorts of people maybe

[00:57:24] maybe that's self-defeating four out for your own positions I think

[00:57:27] I think there are you know I think one should not underestimate how many people

[00:57:31] you know have have a form of Stockholm Syndrome here

[00:57:35] so some other ideas at some

[00:57:39] point when we were talking about and I should have said earlier that the teal

[00:57:42] fellowship for those who don't know is a program that

[00:57:46] has historically at least began paying very

[00:57:50] young people who'd been admitted to colleges to drop out of those

[00:57:53] colleges so they got to keep the idea that they'd been admitted to

[00:57:57] some fairly prestigious place but then they were given

[00:58:00] money to actually live their dreams and not put them on yes it was it was

[00:58:04] it has been an extremely successful and effective program

[00:58:08] it's not scalable right so so we had a hack

[00:58:12] the um we had a hack the prestige status thing where

[00:58:15] it was as hard or harder to get a teal fellowship than

[00:58:19] to get into a top university Randa and so that's

[00:58:22] that's part that's that's very hard to scale well so when

[00:58:26] I was looking at that program for you one

[00:58:30] of the things that I floated was the idea that

[00:58:33] if you look at every advanced degree like

[00:58:37] a a JD or an

[00:58:41] MD PhD none of them seem

[00:58:45] to carry the requirement of having a BA which is quite mysterious

[00:58:48] and if you fail to get a PhD let's

[00:58:52] say there's usually an embedded master's degree that you get is a going-away

[00:58:56] present and therefore if you could get people to

[00:59:00] skip college if you give them perhaps four

[00:59:04] years of their lives back and you could use

[00:59:07] the first year of graduate school which is very often kind of a rapid recapitulation

[00:59:12] of what undergraduate was everybody's a level playing field and then

[00:59:15] it worse comes to worse people would leave as a mass with a masters they would in general get

[00:59:19] a stipend because a lot of the tuition is remitted

[00:59:23] to them in graduate programs is that a viable program

[00:59:27] to get some group of people who are highly motivated

[00:59:31] to avoid the BA

[00:59:34] entirely is sort of the administrators degree rather than the professor's

[00:59:38] degree um let me see I

[00:59:42] yes I mean all these different subtle critiques I can have our

[00:59:46] disagreements but yeah I think look I think I think the BA is not as valuable as

[00:59:50] it looks I also think the PhD is not as valuable as it looks I

[00:59:54] sort of feel it's it's it's it's it's it's a it's a problem across

[00:59:57] the board it strikes me that what you're proposing is a bit of an

[01:00:01] uphill struggle because um at the top

[01:00:05] universities the BA is the far more prestigious degree than

[01:00:08] a PhD at this point so if you're at Stanford or Harvard

[01:00:12] you know it's it's it's pretty hard to get in to

[01:00:16] the undergraduate and then you have you have more PhD

[01:00:20] students then you have undergraduates there all these people who

[01:00:24] are on you know a very questionable track

[01:00:28] they've made a questionable choices it's not clear you know

[01:00:32] you know and so if you sort of and and and

[01:00:36] and they're probably probably are gonna have some sort of psychological breakdown

[01:00:39] in their future you know the dating prospects

[01:00:43] aren't good there all these things that are a little bit off

[01:00:47] so yet in theory if you had a super tightly

[01:00:51] controlled ph.d program right that might work but but

[01:00:54] you have to at least make those those two changes you know as it is the

[01:00:58] people in in graduate school it's like it's like tribbles and Star Trek

[01:01:01] and you know it's it's it there's you know we have you know just

[01:01:05] so many and they all feel expendable and

[01:01:10] unneeded and it's it's sort of it's just

[01:01:14] that's that's not a good that's not a good place to be you know and

[01:01:17] and where's I think the undergraduate conceit is still

[01:01:21] that it's more you know k-selected instead of our selector that it's more on

[01:01:25] that everybody is special and valuable you know that's often not

[01:01:28] true either so I'd be critical of both right and and

[01:01:32] I think but yeah if we if we could if

[01:01:35] we could have a real PhD that was required you

[01:01:39] know there was was much harder and that actually led to sort

[01:01:43] of an academic position or some other comparable position

[01:01:46] that would be that'd be good you know one of the questions I always come back to and

[01:01:50] this is what is the teleology these programs where do they where do

[01:01:54] they go and and what I think has gone

[01:01:57] you know um and one of the analogies I've come

[01:02:01] up with is you know I think undergraduate elite undergraduate is

[01:02:05] like junior highschool football you know if you

[01:02:08] always go foot budget I'll see that coming it's it's it's playing football and

[01:02:12] junior high schools probably not damaging for you but

[01:02:16] it's not going anywhere I see because if you keep playing football in high school

[01:02:19] and college and then professionally that's

[01:02:23] just bad and the better you are the more successful you are the

[01:02:27] the let the less well it works and and then

[01:02:31] the question is what's the motivational structure you know when I was an undergraduate in

[01:02:34] the 1980s there was still a part of it where you thought the

[01:02:38] professors were cool it you know might be something you'd like to be at some point in

[01:02:42] the future you know um and and they were role models just

[01:02:45] like in you know junior high school football and an NFL player

[01:02:49] you know would have been a role model but there's great damage in

[01:02:53] both side now now I think it's it's it's you're just yeah you're

[01:02:56] just doing lots of brain damage and and it's it's a track that doesn't

[01:03:00] work and therefore the teleology sort of was broken down so

[01:03:04] undergraduate part of the teleology was that it was preparing you

[01:03:07] for graduate school and that part doesn't work and that's what's that's

[01:03:11] what's gotten deranged who then graduate school well it's preparing

[01:03:14] you to be a postdoc and then well that's the postdoc apocalypse

[01:03:18] where we want to call it postdoc ellipse postdoc ellipse postdoc

[01:03:22] you heard it here folks host ups and and so but

[01:03:26] just at every step I think the teleology the system is is

[01:03:30] in really bad shape it's of course this is true of all these institutions

[01:03:34] with fake growth that are sociopathic or pathological but

[01:03:38] at the universities it's it's it's striking is it's very bad

[01:03:41] and I think this was already true in important ways in a

[01:03:45] back in the 80s early 90s when I was going through the system and when

[01:03:49] I think when I think back on it um I think I

[01:03:52] was most intensely motivated academically in high school

[01:03:56] because the teleology was really clear you were trying to get into a

[01:04:00] good college and then by the time I was at Stanford it

[01:04:03] was a little bit less clear by the time I was a law school really unclear

[01:04:07] what that was going and and I was by the time I was you know 25

[01:04:11] I was far less motivated than then at age 18 so and

[01:04:15] I think I think these dynamics just in a more

[01:04:18] extreme than ever today what I find so dispiriting about your

[01:04:22] your diagnosis is first of all that I agree with second

[01:04:26] of all if we don't train people in these

[01:04:30] fields like if we don't get people to go into molecular biology or bioinformatics

[01:04:34] or something like that we're never going to be able to find

[01:04:38] the low-hanging fruit in that orchard so it seems to me that

[01:04:42] we have to find some way that it makes

[01:04:45] sense for a life to explore these questions one

[01:04:50] of the things that I don't understand and I don't know if you have any insight go ahead and you know go ahead

[01:04:54] keep going well I was gonna say is that um it

[01:04:57] feels to me that almost all of our institutions are carbon

[01:05:01] copies of each other at different levels of quality and that

[01:05:05] there are only a tiny number of actually innovative institutions it

[01:05:08] used to be that you know Reed College was sex drugs and

[01:05:12] Goethe and you had you know st. John's with

[01:05:16] the great books curriculum that didn't look like anything else or Deep Springs and

[01:05:19] the University of Chicago was crazy about young people but

[01:05:23] the diversity of institutions is

[01:05:28] unbelievably low is that wrong I think that's that's

[01:05:32] fair but I I would say yeah beyond

[01:05:36] the bigger problem with a lot of these fields it's yeah I think we have to keep

[01:05:40] training people I think we need to keep training people in physics or even these fields

[01:05:44] that seem completely dead I'm not you know super important but I think the question is um

[01:05:47] we have to always ask is how many people should we be training and

[01:05:51] you know my intuition is you want even if you want the

[01:05:54] gates to be very tight one of my friends is a is

[01:05:59] in the professor in the Stanford Economics Department and

[01:06:02] the way he describes it to me is they have about 30

[01:06:06] graduate students starting PhDs in economics at Stanford every

[01:06:10] year it's you know six to eight years to get a PhD at the

[01:06:14] end of the first year the faculty has an implicit

[01:06:17] ranking of the students where they sort of agreed who the top

[01:06:21] three or four are the top that the ranking never changes the top

[01:06:25] three or four have a are able to get a good position in academia the others

[01:06:28] not so much and and you know this is

[01:06:32] it we're pretending to be kind to people and we're actually being cruel incredibly

[01:06:36] cruel um and and and so I think that that

[01:06:40] if there are going to be you know it's a supply demand of labor

[01:06:44] if they're gonna be good um good positions in academia where

[01:06:48] you can you know have a reasonable life it's

[01:06:52] not a monastic vow of poverty that you're taking to be an academic if we're

[01:06:55] gonna have that you want you don't want the sort of Malthusian

[01:07:00] struggle if you have ten graduate students in a chemistry lab

[01:07:03] and you have to have a fistfight for a Bunsen burner or a beaker and you

[01:07:07] know if somebody says one politically incorrect thing you

[01:07:11] can happily throw everyone them off out of the overcrowded bus but

[01:07:14] the bus is still overcrowded with nine people on it that's that's what's unhealthy

[01:07:18] and so yes it's it's it would be a mistake to say we

[01:07:21] should dial this down and have you know zero people right at least feels

[01:07:25] that this is what's scary that's it that's not that's that's not what

[01:07:28] I'm advocating or what what's what's being advocated here but but

[01:07:33] but there is a there's a point where if you just add

[01:07:37] more and more people in in a in a starvation Malthusian

[01:07:41] context that's not healthy well this gets to another topic which

[01:07:44] i think is really important and it's a dangerous one to discuss which is

[01:07:49] it it seems to me that

[01:07:53] power laws those distributions

[01:07:57] with very thick tails where you have

[01:08:00] a small number of outliers that often dominate all other

[01:08:04] activity are ubiquitous and

[01:08:08] that particularly with respect to talent whether

[01:08:12] we like them or not they seem to be present where

[01:08:16] a small number of people do a fantastic

[01:08:19] amount of all of all of the innovation what

[01:08:23] do we do if power laws are common to

[01:08:27] make people more comfortable with the fact that there is

[01:08:31] a kind of endowment inequality that seems

[01:08:35] to be part of species makeup I don't

[01:08:39] even think it's just limited to humans well I

[01:08:43] I'm not convinced these sort of power laws are

[01:08:48] equally true in all all fields of activity so

[01:08:52] I think there are you know when the United States was a frontier country

[01:08:56] in the 19th century right and you know most

[01:09:00] people were farmers and presumably some people were better farmers

[01:09:03] than others but you know everyone started within 140 acres of land

[01:09:07] and and there was this wide-open frontier

[01:09:11] even if you had some parts of the society that had

[01:09:15] more of a power-law dynamic there was a large part that didn't and

[01:09:18] that was that was what what I think gave it a certain

[01:09:22] certain amount of health and yeah the challenges if we've

[01:09:26] geared our society saying that all that matters

[01:09:30] is education and and PhDs

[01:09:34] and academic research and that this has this crazy power

[01:09:37] law dynamic then then you're just going to have a society in

[01:09:41] which there are you know lots of people playing video games and

[01:09:45] basements or something like that so that's uh that's uh that's

[01:09:48] that's that's the way I would I would frame it but yeah I think I think there are there's definitely

[01:09:52] are some areas where this is the case and and then you

[01:09:56] know we just need you know we need we need more growth for the whole society if you have growth

[01:10:01] you'll have a rising tide that lifts all boats and so it's always

[01:10:04] you know it's the stagnation is the problem well you know

[01:10:08] I I've joked about this as we are not

[01:10:12] even communistic in our progressivism because the old

[01:10:16] formulation of communism was from each according to his abilities to each

[01:10:20] according to his needs and the inability to recognize different

[01:10:24] levels of ability I mean like almost every mathematician

[01:10:28] or physicists who encountered John VII Normans just said he the guy

[01:10:32] is smarter than I am it's not necessarily the deepest or he did all of the great

[01:10:35] work but you know when you're dealing with somebody

[01:10:39] who is able to employ skills that

[01:10:43] you simply don't have I mean I know I'm not a concert pianist and

[01:10:47] right okay I I don't I don't know how you solve the social

[01:10:50] problem right if everybody has to be a mathematician or a concert pianist that

[01:10:54] that that like well I want a society in which we have great mathematicians

[01:10:58] and great answered pianists that that seems that

[01:11:02] that would be very healthy society right it's very unhealthy if every parent

[01:11:06] thinks their child has to be a mathematician or initiative pianist

[01:11:10] and and that's that's that's the kind of society we we

[01:11:13] unfortunately have well this is why so this is where why

[01:11:17] I try to sell you sometimes on a more progressive view

[01:11:21] of the world which is I want deregulated

[01:11:25] capitalism I want the people who have the rare skill sets

[01:11:28] to be able to integrate across many different areas and to be honest

[01:11:32] you know this is the thing that that I wish more people understood about

[01:11:35] what you bring which is that you're able to think in

[01:11:40] fifteen different idioms that most people only have one or two of

[01:11:43] and so whatever it is that you're doing to integrate these things as an investor

[01:11:47] into direct research and direct work is is really something

[01:11:51] that you know I've watched firsthand for six years [Music]

[01:11:56] the problem that I have is we are going

[01:12:00] to have to take care of the median individual and I less think that

[01:12:03] the median individual is going to be reachable by the market over time

[01:12:07] as some of these things that are working in Silicon

[01:12:11] in terms of machine learning like but then then you're being

[01:12:15] you're being more optimistic on on progress

[01:12:18] and in tech than is because look I think I think yes

[01:12:22] look if we had if we have runaway automation right

[01:12:26] and you know if we're building robots

[01:12:30] that are smarter than humans and can do everything humans can do

[01:12:33] then we probably have to have a serious conversation about a

[01:12:37] universal basic income err or something like that and you're gonna end up

[01:12:40] with you know a very very weird society I don't I

[01:12:44] don't see the automation happening at all and I think

[01:12:48] the question of automation in my mind is identical to this question

[01:12:52] of productivity growth um there is you

[01:12:55] know we've been automating for 200 250 years since the Industrial

[01:12:59] Revolution agriculture and industry factoring and

[01:13:03] the sort of society we have in the early 21st century is

[01:13:07] one in which most jobs

[01:13:11] our non-tradable service sector jobs that are not

[01:13:14] easily automatable so it's like a waiter and restaurant it's a

[01:13:18] yoga instructor it's nurse it's a kindergarten teacher and that's

[01:13:22] what that's what most jobs in our society are and because

[01:13:26] they're so they've been so resistant to automation

[01:13:30] that this may be one of the reasons why um

[01:13:34] the productivity numbers are are slowing down even if we're still

[01:13:37] innovating as fast and manufacturing and even if we're still improving agriculture

[01:13:42] they're smaller and smaller part of the economy and so even 5%

[01:13:46] of your productivity growth in manufacturing that means a lot more than manufacturing 60%

[01:13:50] of the economy than it does when it's a 20% of the economy and so that's that's

[01:13:54] roughly uh that's roughly what I what I think

[01:13:58] I think would happen and you

[01:14:02] know if you just if you just look at the you know the current the current dynamic

[01:14:06] in the u.s. is we have you know unemployment like 3.6 3.7

[01:14:10] percent right it's super low it's um and

[01:14:13] still there doesn't seem to be that much wage pressure that

[01:14:17] there doesn't seem to be that much growth the productivity numbers still aren't great

[01:14:21] you think there'd be enormous and quite conservative me yeah um but

[01:14:25] I think again Mike Mike my read on it is just the the automation story

[01:14:28] has been oversold like I agree the automation story's been over it's like it's possible

[01:14:32] it's going to happen the hospitals just around the corner and it's about about to happen

[01:14:36] well that's what we've been told in a lot of these areas over the last you know

[01:14:39] 40 50 years so I have a couple questions about this one is

[01:14:43] sort of if I think about how common retail occupations are

[01:14:46] is there something about retail that is resistant to

[01:14:50] Amazon ofin if you will where people

[01:14:54] actually want to go shop in a physical place and are willing to pay a premium that

[01:14:58] we haven't understood but to have human contact maybe there's some information exchanged

[01:15:02] maybe there's a recreational aspect that's bundled that's one of my two

[01:15:05] questions the other one surrounds the idea that we've always focused

[01:15:09] on like when is a GI coming and the robots that will do everything and

[01:15:13] part of the lesson for me about machine learning is how

[01:15:17] many things humans were doing that don't require anything like

[01:15:20] artificial general intelligence just some specialized neural

[01:15:24] net seems to be good enough to do the job so those would be

[01:15:28] two questions in my mind as to how yes

[01:15:32] yes but I think all these things you know you have to you have to concretize

[01:15:36] right and yes i i think retail is

[01:15:40] is a sector that's under you know quite

[01:15:44] a bit of pressure is going to stay under quite a bit of pressure that

[01:15:47] that's maybe the top that's the the top one I would it's pretty looks

[01:15:51] like vulnerable to me but that's the and you

[01:15:55] know and that's sort of that's like Amazon is the is the most

[01:15:59] threatening of the big tech companies and that it's you know threatening a lot of

[01:16:02] other companies elsewhere in the industry and disrupting them and you

[01:16:06] know making things more efficient but you know probably with with

[01:16:10] a lot of sheer forces at work in that process so

[01:16:13] um so I agree that that's a candidate for you

[01:16:17] know automation or productivity improvements or things like that I'm

[01:16:21] still not convinced that it's in the aggregate shifting

[01:16:24] things that much you know and then go through and go through all sorts of

[01:16:28] individual job descriptions where you

[01:16:32] know uh people used to have secretaries because

[01:16:36] typing was a skill and you know the word processor

[01:16:39] you don't quite need this you can do short emails you don't quite need a secretary people

[01:16:43] still have executive assistants that sort of somehow do slightly

[01:16:47] different set of responsibilities but it's it's not clearly a fewer executive assistants

[01:16:51] that we used to have secretaries and so when one actually concretize

[01:16:55] is it it's uh it's it's not quite clear how

[01:16:59] much you know how disruptive the

[01:17:03] automation that's happening you know it really is it's a it's

[01:17:07] always straight is he and this is it's a version of the text AG nation thing right it's

[01:17:11] always last 4050 years things have been slow we're

[01:17:14] always told it's about to accelerate like crazy that may be true in

[01:17:18] some ways I hope that's true um but if one was simply

[01:17:21] extrapolating from the last 40 to 50 years perhaps

[01:17:25] the the default is that we should be more worried about the lack of automation than

[01:17:29] excess automation that's really interesting and and so yes if

[01:17:33] and again I think if we had the sort of runaway automation

[01:17:37] I mean you could get to like 3/4 percent GDP growth and at

[01:17:41] 3 to 4 percent GDP growth we can solve these problems socially you

[01:17:44] would be willing to have like you know this thing that I've been talking to

[01:17:48] Andrew yang about has been the idea of hyper capitalism

[01:17:52] which is a deregulated hyper kappa hyper capitalism

[01:17:55] where you can do more experimenting or playing

[01:17:59] copper couple to some kind of hyper socialism where

[01:18:03] you recognize that the median individual might not be able in the future to

[01:18:07] easily defend a position needed

[01:18:11] for family formation well let me rephrase

[01:18:14] this a little bit you're not gonna get a conversion experience on your first podcast here

[01:18:18] to make me wait for the next and maybe a little longer than that too

[01:18:22] but I would say um if

[01:18:26] we can get the GDP growth back to 3 percent a

[01:18:30] year on a sustainable basis without fudging without fudging without

[01:18:34] lying about productivity numbers etc then on there will be a

[01:18:37] lot more room for for various

[01:18:41] social programs I wouldn't want them to be misdirected in all sorts of ways but

[01:18:45] there would be a lot of things that we we could we could do I

[01:18:49] should say and I'm and um I I

[01:18:52] would be very uncomfortable starting with the social programs without

[01:18:57] the growth and and that's that's the that's the sort of conversation

[01:19:01] that I often see happening in Silicon Valley where where it's we start

[01:19:04] with ubi right because we're lying about automation if

[01:19:08] automation of automation is happening then we'll

[01:19:12] see in the productivity numbers and then eventually maybe we need something like ubi if

[01:19:15] automation is not happening and you do ubi then you

[01:19:19] just you know blow up the economy right I should say and you

[01:19:23] know you've caused a question you know it's you've come somewhat toward coming them doing

[01:19:26] them in parallel yeah I'm ok with that no no I'm not not ok with starting

[01:19:31] with the socialism well so I appreciate you even a Marxist

[01:19:34] wouldn't believe this even a Marxist thinks to the you have to first get the capitals to do things

[01:19:38] before you can redistribute stuff right I know and you can't start with a redistribution

[01:19:41] before we've done the automation I'm not even a Marxist Peter but the thing that I

[01:19:45] was going to say is is that as you talk about the fact that we can solve some

[01:19:49] of these problems socially I want talk about from the progressive side I'm

[01:19:52] not interested in using social programs

[01:19:56] where markets continue to function I mean the

[01:20:00] idea of making people personally accountable for their own happiness

[01:20:04] and their own success and path through the world is incredibly

[01:20:08] liberating and I view markets as providing

[01:20:12] most of the progress that we now enjoy so there

[01:20:16] is something that's very weird and punitive about the desire

[01:20:19] for redistribution I mean that there's a almost a desire to

[01:20:23] tag the wealthy that has nothing to do with taking care

[01:20:27] of the unfortunate and what I really

[01:20:31] am talking about here is how do we get a

[01:20:34] conversation between left and right which isn't

[01:20:38] cryptic which isn't you know of course I have a much

[01:20:41] more cynical view of this where I think the redistribution rhetoric

[01:20:46] it's mainly not even targeted at the wealthy oh it's targeted

[01:20:49] at the lower middle class at the deplorable

[01:20:53] z-- or whatever you want to call them and it's a way to tell them that

[01:20:57] they will never get ahead nothing will happen in their life and

[01:21:01] and that's that's actually why you know a lot of

[01:21:04] people who are lower middle class or middle class are

[01:21:08] viscerally quite strongly opposed to welfare

[01:21:11] because it's always an insult to them and he's always heard as an

[01:21:15] insult and and I'm not sure they're wrong to feel

[01:21:18] that well and I feel that a lot of the talk about redistribution is actually

[01:21:23] families of hi 8 through 11 figures

[01:21:28] trying to figure out how to target families of

[01:21:31] six figure through low eight figure wealth as

[01:21:35] the targets of the redistribution that the very wealthy will be able to shelter

[01:21:39] assets and protect themselves or maybe even you

[01:21:43] know switch switch Nations whereas people who are dentists

[01:21:47] and orthodontists and accountants are going to be

[01:21:50] the ones viewed as the rich who are going to be incapable of

[01:21:54] getting themselves out of the way so I think that partially what

[01:21:58] what good-faith conversation between left and right opens

[01:22:02] up is is that we have a shared interest in uncovering all

[01:22:06] of the schemes of the people who enjoy pushing around pieces

[01:22:09] of paper and giving speeches in order to engineer

[01:22:13] society for their own reason so that's one way I would I would restate what you

[01:22:16] just said sure would be that um you

[01:22:21] know redistribution from the powerful

[01:22:25] to the powerless from the rich to the poor is like from

[01:22:29] the powerful to the powerless and so you're using power to go after those

[01:22:33] with power and that's almost oxymoronic it's

[01:22:36] almost self contradictory and so on there may

[01:22:40] be some way to do that I think most the time

[01:22:44] you end up with with some fake redistribution some

[01:22:48] sort of complicated shell game of one sort or another right and

[01:22:52] you know the the very end I know the the causation stuff is

[01:22:56] much much trickier but if we if we look at societies that

[01:22:59] are you know somehow further to the left on some scale right

[01:23:03] um the inequality you have to go really far to the left before and

[01:23:06] maybe just destroy the whole society before you really start solving you

[01:23:10] know the inequality program problem California when I first moved here as a

[01:23:14] kid in 1977 would have been sort of a centrist

[01:23:18] state in the u.s. politically and it was broadly middle-class today

[01:23:22] California is the second most democratic states a d-plus

[01:23:25] 30 state it's a super unequal and and

[01:23:29] at least on a correlated basis and not causation but at least on

[01:23:32] a correlated basis on the further to the left it's gone the more unequal

[01:23:36] it's become and there is something pretty weird about that there

[01:23:40] is you know something that to fits in here

[01:23:43] is that in part I've learned from you and

[01:23:47] you can tell me whether you recognize that this formulation or not is

[01:23:51] start with any appealing social idea

[01:23:56] that's step one step two ask what is

[01:23:59] the absolute minimum level of violence and coercion that would

[01:24:03] be necessary to accomplish that idea now add that to

[01:24:07] the original idea do you still find your original idea attractive

[01:24:11] mm-hm and that this flips many of these

[01:24:15] propositions into territory

[01:24:19] where I suddenly realized that something that people see is being very

[01:24:23] attractive actually can only be accomplished with so

[01:24:27] much misery right even if it's done maximally efficiently that

[01:24:30] it's no longer a good idea and I think that this influence I mean

[01:24:34] this has been very influential in my thinking and what I've yeah

[01:24:38] that look the the the visceral problem with communism is not is

[01:24:42] not its redistributed tendencies it's the extreme

[01:24:45] violence that you have to kill tons of people you know there's always there's

[01:24:49] always a one of the professor's I studied under at Stanford Rene Girard was

[01:24:53] from great philosophical sociological anthropological

[01:24:57] thinker and uh you know he had this observation that he thought

[01:25:01] communism among Western intellectuals became unfashionable

[01:25:04] you could dated to the year 1953 the Year Stalin

[01:25:08] died and the reason was they were they were not communists in

[01:25:12] spite of the millions of people being killed they were communists because

[01:25:16] of the millions of people that were being killed as long as you were willing to kill millions of

[01:25:19] people that was a tell a sign that you were you

[01:25:23] were building the utopia you were building a great new society and when

[01:25:27] you stopped you know it was gonna be like lethargy of the

[01:25:31] Brezhnev ear or something like that and that that was not inspiring I mean people shift

[01:25:34] from Stalin to Mao or Castro or but but the the

[01:25:39] violence was charismatic ice being very charismatic and

[01:25:42] then not but then also you know if you think about it's very undesirable

[01:25:46] I think that there it's so fascinating that we actually finally

[01:25:50] get to something like this I think that that is a correct

[01:25:53] description of part of the communist movement but not all of

[01:25:57] the communist movement there were a lot of people I think in that you just my own family

[01:26:00] was certainly involved in far-left politics and some of it probably

[01:26:04] dipped into communism what my sense of it was is

[01:26:08] that there was a period in the 30s where people realized that there

[01:26:11] had to be coordinated social action and that there were people who were too vulnerable

[01:26:15] and that that somehow got wrapped

[01:26:19] up in all of the things that Stalin was talking

[01:26:22] about that sounded positive if you didn't know the reality so

[01:26:26] for example Paul robes and you know a hero of the

[01:26:30] of the of the left you know was extolling starla Stalin's

[01:26:33] virtues openly my guess is is that he didn't

[01:26:37] fully understand what had happened that he'd gotten involved in an earlier

[01:26:41] era and that as things became known and progressed there was a point

[01:26:45] which many people suddenly open their eyes and said I've been making excuses for

[01:26:49] the Soviet Union because at least it had the hope I mean you

[01:26:52] know there were American blacks for example who moved to Moscow because

[01:26:56] of the the the hope that it was going to be a racially more equal

[01:27:00] society my own family you know I would say was

[01:27:04] talking about you know interracial marriage and

[01:27:08] homosexual opened the support of homosexuality female

[01:27:12] access to birth control those things were associated with the Communist

[01:27:15] Party and a lot of those ideas are now commonplace but

[01:27:19] we forget that you know once upon a time only the Communists

[01:27:23] were willing to dance with these things yes I look I

[01:27:28] what I don't wanna make this to ad hominem but I want to say that people

[01:27:32] like your family yeah we're likely very intelligent

[01:27:36] people but we're somehow still always the useful idiots and

[01:27:40] and there was no

[01:27:44] country where the Communists actually came to power were people like

[01:27:48] those in your family actually got to make the decisions no

[01:27:52] I think so and somehow somehow like

[01:27:56] maybe yeah it maybe there were indirect ways that

[01:28:00] it was helpful or beneficial in countries that did not become communist

[01:28:03] but in countries that actually became communist you

[01:28:07] know it it didn't actually ever seem to work out for those people I

[01:28:11] definitely think that there was some sense that they

[01:28:15] were fooled and duped in this situation but by the same token not

[01:28:19] wanting to make this to ad hominem you know as a

[01:28:22] gay man I think that a lot of your rights would have been seen much earlier

[01:28:26] by the communists who were earlier to that party I think that to

[01:28:31] an extent some of the things

[01:28:34] that we just take for granted as part of living in a tolerant society

[01:28:38] we're really not found outside and so if you were trying to dine

[01:28:42] a la carte maybe you could take something from the

[01:28:46] comedy buffet you could take something from the anti-communist buffet

[01:28:49] and you could steal a little from you know regular

[01:28:53] party politics of course the Dixiecrats were not exactly

[01:28:57] the most racially progressive group in the world things were very different and

[01:29:01] there was no clear place to turn

[01:29:04] yes always it's always easy for us to judge people in

[01:29:08] the past - too harshly so I think I think that's a that's a that's a good

[01:29:11] generalization I I would I would

[01:29:15] say that the you know that there's

[01:29:19] something about the the revolution at the extreme

[01:29:23] revolutionary movements that always um seem to be from

[01:29:27] my point view the violence was always too much and I wind and you know it's a it's

[01:29:31] a it's a package it's a package deal but I

[01:29:35] don't like the violence part of the package that's that's that's the

[01:29:38] that's the part that at the end of the day makes me think the package would

[01:29:42] not have been worth it so what I would like to do is to take a quick break and I would like

[01:29:46] to come back on exactly this point because it's the point where I feel that perhaps

[01:29:49] you are least understood by the outside

[01:29:53] world with in terms of what we've been talking about both growth

[01:29:57] and progress on the one hand and violence on the other so

[01:30:01] when we come back we'll pick it up with Peter Thiel thank you thanks

[01:30:05] welcome back to the portal I'm here with my friend and

[01:30:09] employer Peter Thiel for this our inaugural interview episode

[01:30:13] and we just gotten to a point which I think I hope

[01:30:17] people who have been tracking your career your books your thought

[01:30:20] process are gonna find interesting because I think it's the

[01:30:24] thing that if I had to guess would be the thing that people at least understand

[01:30:28] about you or maybe they have wrong the most ever since

[01:30:31] I've known you your focus has weirdly

[01:30:35] been reduction of violence across a great number

[01:30:39] of different topics at a level that I don't think has leaked out into

[01:30:43] the public's understanding of you and what causes you

[01:30:47] to make the choices you make how do you

[01:30:50] see growth as attached

[01:30:54] to reduction of violence

[01:30:59] well I think that it's um

[01:31:03] it's very hard to see how anything like the kinds

[01:31:07] of societies we have in Western Europe the United States

[01:31:11] could function without without growth I think you know

[01:31:15] I think the way sort of a parliamentary Republican democracy works

[01:31:19] is you have a group of people sitting around the table they craft complicated

[01:31:23] legislation and there's a lot of horse trading and as

[01:31:27] long as the pie is growing you can give something to everybody when

[01:31:30] the pie stops growing it becomes a zero-sum dynamic and

[01:31:34] the legislative process does not work and and so

[01:31:38] the sort of democratic types

[01:31:42] of parliamentary systems we've had for the last 200 250

[01:31:46] years have mapped on to this period of of

[01:31:50] rapid growth we had sort of a very bad experiment in

[01:31:54] the 1930s where the growth stopped at least sort of Nathan

[01:31:57] economic sense and the system you

[01:32:01] know systems became fascist or communist it didn't it

[01:32:05] doesn't actually work and so I I suspect that if

[01:32:08] we're in for a period of long growth I don't

[01:32:12] think um I don't think our our kind of government can work I

[01:32:16] think there is a prospect of all sorts of forms of violence

[01:32:20] more violence by the state against the citizens there

[01:32:24] may be more zero-sum Wars globally or there

[01:32:27] may be other ways things are super deformed to pacify people so maybe

[01:32:31] you know maybe everyone just smokes marijuana all day but that's that also kind of

[01:32:34] deformed but I think I think a world without growth is either going

[01:32:39] to be a much more violent or a much more deformed world and

[01:32:42] and again it's you know it's not the case that growth simply

[01:32:47] solves all problems so you can have very rapid growth and

[01:32:51] it can still you can still have the problem of violence you can still you can still have

[01:32:54] bad things that can happen but that's our only chance without

[01:32:58] growth I think I think it's very hard to see how you have a good future now

[01:33:02] in some sense whenever I hear you interpreted

[01:33:07] in the private means look you or you have to know that

[01:33:10] there is a version of a view that

[01:33:14] exists in the minds of pundits and you

[01:33:18] know the commentariat that just loves to paint you as

[01:33:21] if you were a cartoon villain and I always think that

[01:33:25] for those people who are actually confused about you as

[01:33:28] opposed to those who wish to be confused about you it says

[01:33:32] if you're looking through a window and they're

[01:33:36] looking at the reflection in the window not understanding what it is

[01:33:39] that you're focused on why do you think it is that

[01:33:44] almost nobody sees your preoccupation with

[01:33:48] violence reduction well it's um I

[01:33:56] I think um I think

[01:34:00] is always hard for me to come with a good answer these sort of sociological

[01:34:04] questions I think that I think people generally

[01:34:08] don't think of the problem of violence as quite as central as I

[01:34:11] I think I think it is I think it is a I think it's you know I'm

[01:34:15] a very deep problem you know on a human level if

[01:34:20] you think of sort of this mimetic element to human nature where

[01:34:23] we copy one another we want the things other people want

[01:34:27] and there's sort of there's a there's a lot of

[01:34:31] room for conflict and

[01:34:34] that you know if it's not channeled very carefully a violent

[01:34:38] conflict in human relationships and in human societies between

[01:34:42] human societies and this this is sort of I think

[01:34:45] a very very deep problem and it's it's not you

[01:34:49] know sort of there's Christian anthropology but you also have the same in

[01:34:52] Machiavelli or you know there are serve a lot

[01:34:56] of different traditions where you know human beings are if not

[01:34:59] evil they're at least dangerous and and I think I

[01:35:03] think the sort of softer anthropological

[01:35:07] biases that that a lot of people have in

[01:35:10] you know sort of late modernity or in the Enlightenment world

[01:35:14] are that you know humans are by nature good they're

[01:35:19] by nature peaceful um and that's not

[01:35:22] the norm so there's you know that might be sort of a general bias people

[01:35:26] have is that people can't be this vile it's not it's not the stipa

[01:35:30] problem it's a problem other people have there's some bad people

[01:35:34] who are violent but it's not a general problem you know one

[01:35:38] of the things that I think has been fascinating to me in

[01:35:41] you know I mean effectively I didn't

[01:35:45] know you when I was young and this feels like a lifelong friendship that got started

[01:35:49] way late in my life and one of the things that that kind of was surprising

[01:35:52] to me is that my coming from a Jewish

[01:35:56] background you're coming from a German background I think both of us

[01:35:59] were sent this sensitized by the horrors of World

[01:36:03] War two which I mean obviously the problem for the Jews

[01:36:07] is very clear but the fact that Germany never

[01:36:10] really recovered its proud intellectual traditions

[01:36:14] that had gotten bound up in a level of mechanized

[01:36:18] and planned violence you know the decimation

[01:36:21] of a great intellectual tradition and one of the things we've talked

[01:36:25] about in the past is whether the twilight of living memory of

[01:36:28] the Holocaust should be used for some more

[01:36:32] profound German Jewish reconciliation that these are two

[01:36:36] communities that have held somewhat similar

[01:36:40] thought processes from the perspective of memetic competition

[01:36:44] maybe you know there was a there were there was a problem that they were doomed to

[01:36:48] run into each other but that in some sense there

[01:36:51] are two wounds that need to be healed now that all of the

[01:36:55] original participants are either quite elderly or

[01:36:58] gone do you think that that is in for our conversation

[01:37:02] well I think I think there's certainly

[01:37:06] um an element of that between between the two of us

[01:37:09] I I think that there's

[01:37:14] there's probably a degree to which on

[01:37:18] the history was

[01:37:22] so traumatic that that people still understate

[01:37:26] the this aspect there was there was something about you know

[01:37:30] late 19th century early 20th century Germany where

[01:37:34] the Judaism was better integrated

[01:37:38] into the society than in many other places and there was something very synergistic

[01:37:42] very very generative about that

[01:37:45] and and and and then

[01:37:50] you know getting at all these ways that at

[01:37:53] the the it was lost are very very hard to do you

[01:37:57] know it's uh it's a you know sort of a a the

[01:38:01] sort of social democratic response to the

[01:38:04] Hitler era and the Holocaust was sort of radically

[01:38:08] egalitarian and it's everybody's equal you shouldn't kill

[01:38:12] people everybody is equally valuable and yet in

[01:38:15] some ways what was Hitler killed the best people and so there's

[01:38:19] a way in which the the social democratic response to to what

[01:38:23] happened doesn't even come up to the

[01:38:26] terrible thing that happened so inegalitarian society will we don't

[01:38:30] miss quite as many people were all equal nothing's really changed but but

[01:38:34] well maybe you have no Jewish people left in Germany and there's a lot less dynamism

[01:38:38] in the society as a result and that's something that people

[01:38:42] still can't say in Germany because that's that right you feel like it's uh

[01:38:46] you know like if I say it people

[01:38:49] won't they won't they won't contradicted or anything but

[01:38:54] but it's uh it's you know it's

[01:38:58] it's sort of profoundly profoundly uncomfortable so

[01:39:01] I think I think there is a sense yeah that that you

[01:39:05] know it's there's from all these strange ways that Germany still under

[01:39:08] the shadow of Hitler even even you know the ways that people are trying

[01:39:12] to you know exercise Hitler you know in some ways

[01:39:16] have deformed the society where you can't you

[01:39:19] can't go back to the things that worked incredibly well in

[01:39:23] you know pre-world War one Germany there was probably a lot there was unhealthy

[01:39:27] and wrong with it too but but but yeah there's a sense that something

[01:39:31] um you know something something

[01:39:34] very big has been lost there's that probably are a Jewish version of

[01:39:38] this that one could one could articulate as well

[01:39:41] but but yeah I think there's something about the synergy that's uh that's

[01:39:45] that's very powerful and that's quite missing

[01:39:49] so you know from from my side of the fence I was

[01:39:52] just listening on NPR to a description of Fiddler on the Roof being

[01:39:56] put on by Joel Grey in Yiddish and the

[01:40:00] sound of you know Jewish Middle High German

[01:40:05] there's something about it that is shocking in

[01:40:09] today's era and so there's been a

[01:40:12] Jewish loss you know I felt this a couple of times I avoided

[01:40:17] to be honest going to Germany because

[01:40:21] I didn't want to run into old people and wonder where they had been

[01:40:24] but eventually at Soros

[01:40:28] invitation found myself at a conference in Berlin and when I checked into the

[01:40:32] hotel I heard my last name pronounced in you know impeccable

[01:40:35] German and it was both a horrible

[01:40:39] feeling and a wonderful feeling like somehow weirdly something

[01:40:44] was home or I went to a restaurant near checkpoint charlie with my wife and

[01:40:48] I was missing a fork even like the person

[01:40:51] spoke no English and I remembered from a some

[01:40:55] old story of my father and I asked for a Gopal which

[01:40:59] I guess is the Yiddish for fork and it was close enough and somebody brought me a

[01:41:02] fork and by uttering a word that I got

[01:41:06] gobble gobble gobble okay Sherman yes by by

[01:41:10] going through that exercise I found that when this fork was

[01:41:14] brought to me I realized that there was some part of my experience

[01:41:17] in fact that was missing that this uncomfortable relationship

[01:41:21] which you know my grandfather when we when we went

[01:41:25] through Israel driving north to

[01:41:29] south was singing leader

[01:41:33] I mean he was German was the language of of

[01:41:37] the culture it was the language of the intellectual and that never

[01:41:40] left him and so I think that weirdly this

[01:41:45] is the first time because I think it'll be

[01:41:48] too late if we wait for in 20 more years because there will be no one to remember

[01:41:52] but that there is some opportunity to recognize a dual

[01:41:56] wound yeah no I um I

[01:42:00] think I think the I think the challenge

[01:42:04] on the on the Germany side is that it's it's it's it's sort of

[01:42:07] I had I'd somewhat of a you know idiosyncratic background here where we

[01:42:12] I was born in Germany but we emigrated when I was about a year old and

[01:42:15] uh and and you know he spoke German at

[01:42:19] home and lived in Africa and Namibia

[01:42:23] where it went to German speaking school but it

[01:42:27] was it was very different I think from the from from the

[01:42:31] general post-world war ii german experience and

[01:42:35] and i and so there are gather all

[01:42:39] these things that i can see from the outside looking in to germany

[01:42:42] that i think are you know it's still like

[01:42:46] i still have a connection to it and this of all these ways you

[01:42:50] know you visited it as a child many times and this is something that

[01:42:53] i connect with and it's it's obviously like like super different you

[01:42:57] know and and the the sort

[01:43:01] of you know the contrast of germany in california

[01:43:05] always like to give is that california's optimistic but desperate

[01:43:08] and germany's pessimistic but comfortable but the from

[01:43:12] a Californian perspective the past the the incredibly deep pessimism

[01:43:16] is is is is is is really

[01:43:20] really striking and and even on that one dimension

[01:43:24] i think you know jewish culture is is super different

[01:43:27] well and I feel like Jewish culture is in part

[01:43:31] starting to attenuate that we don't feel I

[01:43:35] mean this is this is crazy talk but we never

[01:43:38] thought that there was anything positive about anti-semitism and obviously

[01:43:43] it's not a positive thing but there were positive externalities and that

[01:43:46] it allowed us to push ourselves very very hard because we

[01:43:50] always knew that we weren't going to get a fair shake and that at any moment

[01:43:54] you might need to flee to someplace that was less dangerous and I

[01:43:57] feel that as we become comfortable we've lost some of the dynamism which is

[01:44:01] a hard thing to admit but I do think that that is in part true

[01:44:05] just as I see you know and I see this in Germany Germany's

[01:44:09] intellectual contribution was so profound that

[01:44:13] nothing post-world war ii seems to suggest the

[01:44:17] same nation and I think that that loss is a profound

[01:44:20] loss not to Germany but to the entire world yes

[01:44:25] it's uh it's you know and of course one of the challenges

[01:44:29] is you know we can you sort of describe these things we can speculate on you know you

[01:44:33] know some of the causal things it's uh I think

[01:44:37] it's a it's somehow we don't want to go back we

[01:44:41] can't go back and don't want to I agree and uh and so

[01:44:45] yeah there is there's a history and you know I I think

[01:44:49] something's been lost in both Germany and in Jewish

[01:44:53] culture and how when how in reconstitutes

[01:44:57] this is is is even we can convince people of you

[01:45:01] know the causes and the losses what

[01:45:05] you actually do about it is is super hard to say and that's

[01:45:08] uh that's sort of always the the strange

[01:45:12] dynamic in this something I'd be open to us

[01:45:16] working on at some future point if we can find the time but let

[01:45:19] me switch gears slightly and come back a

[01:45:23] little bit to the violence point but one of the things

[01:45:27] that I think has become kind of interesting in our relationship

[01:45:31] is that a a certain class of theories that

[01:45:35] are not popular in the general population are traded

[01:45:39] back and forth between us

[01:45:42] partially around the idea of how do we restart

[01:45:46] growth how do we avoid violence and I wanted

[01:45:50] to sort of alert people who are interested in the portal concept to this

[01:45:53] idea of orphaned or unpopular theories

[01:45:57] that are traded among a few but maybe not among the many

[01:46:01] so if we could go through a few of these one of them has

[01:46:05] to do with how you and I both were

[01:46:08] much more I think

[01:46:12] we believed that Trump was much more likely to get elected than the

[01:46:16] general population did and this has to do with the theory of preference

[01:46:20] falsification that people will broadly lie about

[01:46:23] what their true preferences are so they'll keep one set of public preferences

[01:46:27] but a hidden set of private preferences and then in our culture that

[01:46:31] gets revealed every four years where you might have have a schrödinger's you

[01:46:35] had experiment you find out where the actually is yes

[01:46:39] I ya know I felt this was a dynamic that was going on

[01:46:42] in all these strange ways in in 2016 there was a dinner

[01:46:46] I had in San Francisco about a week before the election with a group of center-right

[01:46:50] people one very prominent angel investor in Silicon

[01:46:54] Valley and he said you know I'm voting for Trump in a week but because I'm in Silicon

[01:46:58] Valley I have to lie and so he was unusually honest about lying and

[01:47:02] and and the way the way I lie is that I tell

[01:47:05] people I'm voting for Gary Johnson's I couldn't say that he was gonna vote for Hillary Clinton like the facial

[01:47:09] muscles wouldn't work or something would go wrong but Gary Johnston was sort

[01:47:12] of the lie that you could could tell and and

[01:47:16] then if you actually look at what happened in the month before the election the gary

[01:47:20] johnson support you know collapsed from - um like six to two percent

[01:47:23] or whatever and as far as i can tell all of that went to to

[01:47:27] trump and and the question one has to ask is

[01:47:31] were these people you know lying all along were

[01:47:35] they lying to themselves did they sincerely change their mind in the last month

[01:47:38] or some some combination of that but but yeah one one sort of

[01:47:42] vehicle for this preference falsification was that you had got a third party

[01:47:46] Canada was sort of a gateway to the transitions this would happen with

[01:47:49] Ross Perot where the people when you know eventually went

[01:47:53] to Clinton in 92 or John Anderson in 1980 so that's been

[01:47:57] that's been a sort of repeated pattern and that's I think that was one element

[01:48:00] of what was going on but then I think there were also um

[01:48:04] all these all these aspects of

[01:48:08] of the Trump candidacy that

[01:48:12] people were super uncomfortable about polite society and and

[01:48:16] so one would you know that the preference falsification was somehow perhaps

[01:48:20] much greater than in in many other other past contexts

[01:48:24] and so you know even even the day of the election the exit polls suggested

[01:48:29] that Trump was going to lose and so there was still a two to three

[01:48:32] percent effect like this literally the day of the voting

[01:48:36] well I look I voted for Bernie in the

[01:48:40] primaries and I felt that both you

[01:48:43] and I had realized that the Clinton

[01:48:47] neoliberal story was a slow-motion

[01:48:52] one-way ticket to disaster if it kept going on election

[01:48:56] after election so that both of us recognized that we had to get off that true

[01:48:59] of course of course one of the complicated questions all this is um you

[01:49:03] know did people actually already this and were they

[01:49:06] lying about this so like everybody was saying all the way throughout 2016

[01:49:10] most of the people are saying there's no chance that you know Trump's gonna win this is absolutely

[01:49:14] impossible and I didn't really connect this before the election

[01:49:18] but with 20/20 hindsight I wonder was

[01:49:22] the fact that everyone was clicking on the Nate Silver a 538

[01:49:26] statistical polling model cite a few times a day to

[01:49:30] reassure themselves that Hillary Clinton was still ahead and was gonna win

[01:49:33] was that some sort of acknowledgment that on some maybe subconscious

[01:49:37] or barely conscious level people sense that it wasn't

[01:49:41] really as done a deal as they they were they were constantly

[01:49:45] saying so so there's there's even a version of that question that I I

[01:49:49] wonder about yeah I'm you know because there was something about the

[01:49:53] polling that took on this unusually iconic role

[01:49:57] in 2016 it was so important and there was no

[01:50:00] truth outside the polls I remember there's you know one of the Democrat

[01:50:05] Talking Heads saying something like you know publicans don't

[01:50:08] believe in you know climate change they also don't believe in polls that's why they're going to lose

[01:50:12] and generally polls are right but there was something about how

[01:50:16] how all-important they were in 2016 that that might have been

[01:50:20] a tell that something something was a little bit of us I think people knew

[01:50:24] and for my from to my way of thinking I think people knew that

[01:50:27] there was something very bizarre about this election I think that the Bernie

[01:50:31] scare that if the Democratic Party hadn't been

[01:50:35] so skillfully and skillful in sidelining Bernie

[01:50:38] and we're the party regulars were you know clearly

[01:50:42] backing Clinton my sense is

[01:50:45] that it could well have been Bernie versus Trump and that would have been

[01:50:49] enough to say the neoliberal story is

[01:50:53] over so I think there was that fear that this was coming to an end

[01:50:57] my sense of it was that the major reaction

[01:51:01] to Trump was sort of a class reaction that it was you're rejecting

[01:51:05] the entire concept of a an educated

[01:51:09] group that knows the right things to say and you

[01:51:13] know you're clearly sort of not the kind of person who should be

[01:51:17] in the Oval Office much more than the issue of whether

[01:51:20] or not Trump was going to be a war monger turned the u.s. into a police state

[01:51:24] which of course doesn't seem to have happened as of this moment in 2019

[01:51:28] yes yes but I guess what my sense

[01:51:32] of it was is that people really were shocked I was because I

[01:51:35] live in a left-of-center universe the day after they certainly

[01:51:39] pretended to be shocked no there's no IIIi look I'll concede

[01:51:42] your point they were they were pretty shocked they were shocked but you

[01:51:47] know if but I still have my question why were they clicking

[01:51:50] on the national interest a few times a day one version of it was

[01:51:55] let's say even if Hillary trounced Trump but

[01:51:58] it wasn't enough that would be a scary thing given what Trump had been built up to

[01:52:02] which is a you know orange Hitler you know if you imagine

[01:52:05] that your country is supporting somebody who thinks all Mexicans are rapists

[01:52:09] and is going to take the country back to you know to the

[01:52:14] Middle Ages it would be very disconcerting if such a person could

[01:52:17] get 20% of the vote so I think that the poll had his own

[01:52:21] significance however

[01:52:25] you know I I think that

[01:52:29] one of the things about preference falsification is is

[01:52:33] that when you start to believe that this is a robust

[01:52:37] phenomenon that all of the economic models that assume that your private preferences

[01:52:41] and public preferences are the same you

[01:52:44] start to see the world very differently and so this is one of the portals

[01:52:48] into an alternate way of seeing the universe so as not to get surprised

[01:52:51] by revolutions well it's always um

[01:52:56] you know it's always this question on in my

[01:52:59] mind this question of preference falsification the two McCrone theories

[01:53:03] tightly coupled to this question of you know how intense

[01:53:07] is the problem of political correctness where

[01:53:11] how how much pressure is there on people

[01:53:14] to say things they don't actually believe and and

[01:53:18] and I you know I I always

[01:53:22] come back to thinking that the problem of political correctness in some sense is our biggest

[01:53:26] political problem that that you know we live in a world where people

[01:53:29] are super uncomfortable say what they think that

[01:53:33] it's it's sort of dangerous to use you use the Silicon Valley context

[01:53:37] um it's a problem that Silicon

[01:53:40] Valley has become a one-party state but there are two different

[01:53:44] senses in which you can be a one-party state one sense is that everybody

[01:53:48] just happens to believe this one thing which you know um

[01:53:52] you know is one thing and then the other one

[01:53:56] is in which 85% of people believe one thing and the other 15% pretend

[01:54:00] to and you know it's for like a it's a dynamic with super

[01:54:04] majorities where you know we is in a democracy we think fifty-one percent

[01:54:07] of people believe something they're probably right if 70 to 80 percent believe

[01:54:11] something it's almost more certainly right but if you have ninety-nine point

[01:54:15] nine nine percent of the people believe something at some point you shifted

[01:54:18] from democratic truth to North Korean and sanity

[01:54:22] and and so there is there's a subtle tipping point

[01:54:26] where the wisdom of crowds shifts

[01:54:30] into into something that's sort of softly totalitarian or something

[01:54:34] like that so in my mind it maps you know very much on to this this

[01:54:38] question of you know the problem of political correctness it's always hard

[01:54:42] to measure how how big it is you know politically correct

[01:54:45] society of course you know we're just saying what we think we all love stalling we all of chairman

[01:54:49] mao and and maybe you know we're just singing

[01:54:53] these songs because we're all enthusiastic about it and and

[01:54:56] i think my read on it is that that's that problem has gotten more

[01:55:00] acute in a lot of parts of our society over the last few decades yeah

[01:55:05] I think that's gotten well as you know I

[01:55:08] started this whole intellectual darkweb concept

[01:55:12] in part to create kind of a broad-based

[01:55:15] and bipartisan coalition of people

[01:55:19] who are willing to speak out in public and take some risk speaking

[01:55:24] for a large number of people I would never have understood how many people feel

[01:55:28] terrified to speak out if I hadn't done that because people come

[01:55:32] up to me all the time and say thank you for saying what I can't say at work

[01:55:35] and then when I asked them well what is it that you can't say it work it's absolutely

[01:55:39] shocking mm-hmm completely commonplace things and things

[01:55:43] that are not at all dangerous not not Saverio frightening one of

[01:55:46] the things I believe and I don't know whether you're gonna you're gonna agree with this is that

[01:55:51] you start to understand that

[01:55:54] a lot of the people who are enforcing the political correctness suspect that

[01:55:59] they are covering up dangerous truths so for example

[01:56:02] if you believe that IQ equals intelligence which I do

[01:56:07] not I mean let's just be honest about it you're

[01:56:11] going to fear anything that shows a variation

[01:56:15] in IQ between groups if you don't believe IQ

[01:56:18] equals intelligence if you believe that intelligence is a much richer

[01:56:22] story and that no group is that far out of the running you're

[01:56:26] not terribly frightened of the data because you have lots of different ways

[01:56:30] of understanding what's happening and also you generally find that the truth

[01:56:34] is the best way of lifting people out of their

[01:56:38] situation so I secretly suspect to be blunt about and this

[01:56:41] is kind of horrible that a lot of Silicon Valley is extremely

[01:56:45] bigoted and misogynistic and it can't actually make

[01:56:49] eye contact with the fact that it secretly thinks women aren't

[01:56:53] as good programmers where I happen to think you know

[01:56:56] fish Aryan equivalents suggests that males and females one

[01:57:00] protein apart sry protein are not likely to be

[01:57:04] I mean they might have different forms of intelligence in different forms of cognitive

[01:57:07] strengths but if you don't actually worry too much about an intellectual

[01:57:11] difference you'd be willing to have an intellectual conversation that

[01:57:15] was quite open about it so maybe I can turn that around is it yeah

[01:57:19] I let me see there's sort of a lot of different things I want to react to there I um

[01:57:22] yeah I suspect that it's it's a distraction

[01:57:26] of sorts you know I think I mean I'm

[01:57:30] this very superficial layer and we want to have we want to have debates

[01:57:33] when I've debates in a lot of areas a lot of you know hard

[01:57:37] questions and their questions in science and technology and philosophy

[01:57:41] religion they're all these questions I think it would be healthy to debate

[01:57:45] and there's a way in which political debates are sort of a low form of

[01:57:49] these questions and there's one sense in which I think of these

[01:57:52] political questions as less important or

[01:57:56] less elevated and some of these others but there's

[01:58:00] also a sense in which these questions about politics are ones that

[01:58:04] that everyone can have access to and

[01:58:08] so if you can't even have a debate about politics

[01:58:12] you can't say you know I like the man with a strange orange hairdo

[01:58:15] or I like the mean grandmother yeah um if

[01:58:19] you can't even say that then then we've sort of frozen out discussion

[01:58:23] on a lot of other areas and that's that's always one of the reasons I think the that

[01:58:27] that political correctness starts with

[01:58:31] correctness about politics and the that's it this time when you

[01:58:34] that when you aren't allowed to talk about that area you implicitly

[01:58:38] frozen out a lot of others that are maybe more important and you know and

[01:58:43] we're you know we're certainly not gonna have a debate about string theory if we can't even have

[01:58:46] a common sense debate about politics or something like that um

[01:58:50] you know it's it's I'm I'm very sympathetic to

[01:58:54] the sort of distraction theory that that

[01:58:57] you know a lot of these sort of that

[01:59:01] what's going on our society is like a psychosocial magic

[01:59:06] hypnotic magic trick where you know we're being distracted from

[01:59:09] from something something very important and political correctness

[01:59:13] identity politics in maybe American exceptionalism sort

[01:59:17] of these these various ideological systems on you know

[01:59:20] are distracting us from things the the you know the thing I keep

[01:59:24] thinking is the main thing is distracting us from is the stagnation and is that

[01:59:28] you know that there are these problems that that we don't want to talk about in our

[01:59:31] society it's possible it's also a way to distract us from bad

[01:59:35] thoughts that we have about people or the sword use you said but

[01:59:38] the one I would go back to first is just that it's distracting us from

[01:59:42] dealing with dealing with problems you know the reason the reason

[01:59:46] we have a new speak the sort of Orwellian Newspeak and politics with these zombie

[01:59:50] politicians and you know you know Hillary Clinton or Jeb

[01:59:53] Bush or whoever it might might be is that

[01:59:57] we're not supposed to talk about the real issues and maybe they have a bad conscience

[02:00:01] and I think they're bad people but it's just I think the primary thing is just too

[02:00:05] dangerous to talk about what's actually going on they don't know what to do about it

[02:00:08] and better not talk about that yeah I think there's another take on

[02:00:12] it which you know if I'm honest about it it probably originates

[02:00:16] from my side of the aisle which is that I have a sense

[02:00:19] that if you believe that productivity and

[02:00:23] growth is over you don't want to emphasize issues of Merit

[02:00:27] because you don't really think that the merit is gonna translate and so therefore all

[02:00:31] you can focus on like you know a board of a company is

[02:00:34] just a bunch of slots at a trough and so you have to make

[02:00:38] sure that every group has its slots at the trough right because it doesn't

[02:00:42] actually matter the board isn't doing anything to begin with and so it's only a question

[02:00:45] of receiving the wealth that is already there and so I worry

[02:00:49] that that is you know I guess where

[02:00:53] I break with a lot of progressives is that I believe that most progress comes

[02:00:57] from progress rights technologically led and informational II led

[02:01:01] that the more we know and the more we can do the more we can take care of people

[02:01:05] yes I I mean again this is always maybe naive

[02:01:09] hope on my part or or um or something

[02:01:13] like this but I always think that when we can't talk about things yeah

[02:01:17] I can't solve them and and that this is exactly and so that maybe these

[02:01:21] are maybe these are the calculations you make and this is you know this is the way

[02:01:24] we Pat people on the head even though they're never gonna get ahead or something like

[02:01:28] that but you know it's never going to work it's

[02:01:34] people aren't that stupid and they will eventually figure it out and so that's

[02:01:38] that's that's sort of why I'm under motivated to play that game yeah

[02:01:42] and I have to say that one of the things that I've learned from

[02:01:45] you is that it's one thing to hold it have a contrarian position

[02:01:49] it's another thing to hold it when the whole world starts hating

[02:01:53] on you for example I watched the world go

[02:01:57] from viewing removing Gawker as removing a nuisance

[02:02:01] or worse that was threatening people selectively

[02:02:06] to a concern you know about

[02:02:12] like First Amendment rights and silencing you

[02:02:15] know free speech and you know III do

[02:02:19] have the strong sense that people are willfully

[02:02:24] misinterpreting these

[02:02:28] actions that are necessary to sort of self correct in our society

[02:02:31] and are not being terribly honest there's a lot

[02:02:35] of bad faith acting and in our system at the moment yeah

[02:02:39] but you know again I'm always I'm always like this again where I'm I'm always quite hopeful

[02:02:43] that people realize there's a lot of bad faith acting and they they

[02:02:47] you know they just can't like go out of it accordingly and I you know um you

[02:02:50] know I I don't know how many of the people disagree with me on the

[02:02:54] the support for Trump you know we'll be more

[02:02:58] open to it in five years or ten years and we'll see on

[02:03:01] the Gawker matter I'm you know I'm gonna win that one and

[02:03:05] and I think that you know I think people

[02:03:09] understand that when it gets criticized by people

[02:03:12] in the media who have themselves are up against

[02:03:16] super challenged business models right they have to act in sociopathic

[02:03:20] ways to get clicks by their readers right that this is just the

[02:03:24] game they have to play I think people I

[02:03:28] agree than you think and uh and therefore

[02:03:31] you know it's it's uh it's not quite

[02:03:35] what it what it looks well but but there's also a way in which boat in both of

[02:03:38] these cases there's nothing I think I was I was extremely disturbed by

[02:03:42] Gawker a decade decade and a half ago because I think it was a really

[02:03:46] powerful thing at the time where it worked because

[02:03:50] people didn't understand how it worked it was this hate factory the scapegoating

[02:03:53] machine but people didn't see it as such um and because

[02:03:58] of that it was it was super powerful once you you know once you see

[02:04:02] how it works once you understand it it is it is less powerful

[02:04:05] so you know even you know had I not succeeded

[02:04:09] in in litigation again against Gawker I think

[02:04:13] it would be a weaker version of that today because and you know there

[02:04:17] are of course equally nasty things on the internet but they're not as powerful because

[02:04:20] a little well-organized people people can sort of us the

[02:04:24] there's more transparency into them into the bad motives and people get it and

[02:04:28] the hate factory only works when it's not perceived

[02:04:31] as such well I think that there is a way in which some of this stuff is slowing

[02:04:35] down because people are getting tired of the constant

[02:04:39] state of beheading figuratively of people

[02:04:43] via their reputation that we've moved from honest physical

[02:04:47] violence into reputational and economic violence against people that

[02:04:51] are considered undesirable but I think that like there's a story with

[02:04:55] both Gawker and Trump which the rest of the world will never

[02:04:58] see and I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't been working

[02:05:02] with you in the case of Gawker I don't think anybody

[02:05:06] even knows the story about how much you sweated the

[02:05:09] ethics internally of how do I do this right how do I make sure that

[02:05:13] I don't hurt anybody that I shouldn't be hurting how do I make sure that this

[02:05:16] represents something narrow and not something broad which

[02:05:20] is the story so far as I know that hasn't been told and then there's the story with

[02:05:24] Trump where I few remember this when Trump

[02:05:28] won you had a gathering

[02:05:31] at your house and you did not invite me and

[02:05:35] I was so pissed at you that

[02:05:39] even though I was tooth and nail against Trump and I remain really

[02:05:44] pretty close to a never Trump er I knew

[02:05:48] why you did what you did I knew that you felt that it was a reduction in violence

[02:05:52] and I think that you had theories that nobody believed

[02:05:55] at the time if I look out at this world F through these windows Trump

[02:05:59] has not changed mostly day to day life except for the

[02:06:03] phenomenon of Trump but it's it's no there's the gate you know

[02:06:06] a policeman on every street corner with a an automatic

[02:06:10] rifle we're not in some sort of siege from

[02:06:14] the White House and you said I think much less is going to happen

[02:06:18] than people imagine and I think we're going to be in a much less interventionist mode

[02:06:21] then we were previously and whether or not you were right or you're

[02:06:25] wrong so far I think you've been borne out to be right on both of those points I

[02:06:29] knew that you had an idea that we had to shake things

[02:06:33] up or we were going to be in some very dangerous situation

[02:06:37] there was I mean I had two speeches

[02:06:40] in 2016 one was at the Republican convention one was at the Washington Press

[02:06:44] Club about a month before the election and in in both speeches

[02:06:48] I you know I underscored the ways in which I think

[02:06:51] Trump would represent a break from the interventionist

[02:06:55] neoconservative neoliberal foreign policies of you know

[02:06:58] on that you know Bush 43 that Obama still

[02:07:02] continued and that Hillary was was likely to can been

[02:07:06] likely to continue on and and I

[02:07:09] still think that that's roughly

[02:07:14] what's happened it's not been it's not been as

[02:07:18] far away from interventionism as I would like but it's directionally

[02:07:22] directionally that's happened and I think and

[02:07:26] I think that you know I do think we're not going

[02:07:29] to go back to that on the Republican side which is like a very important thing

[02:07:33] we're not going to go back to the Bush foreign policy ever yeah that's

[02:07:37] that's in him that's that that was an important thing you know it

[02:07:40] was it was when when in the in the primaries when you

[02:07:44] know publican primaries when when Trump spoke out against

[02:07:48] the Iraq war right that was you know that was a very important moment for my point

[02:07:52] of view yeah and I think you know I think you know we always think of

[02:07:55] the you know I think the way one way to think of the president United States is

[02:07:59] that you're sort of the mayor of this country and but you're the dictator of the

[02:08:03] world because in the u.s. your power is very limited outside

[02:08:06] the US you can do a you know a great number of things and

[02:08:10] that's why I think these these foreign policy questions are actually are

[02:08:14] very important ones in assessing a president

[02:08:18] well may I

[02:08:22] guess my my take on the great

[02:08:25] danger of Trump was that there were certain

[02:08:29] sorts of standards and agreed-upon cultural aspects

[02:08:33] which I've likened to the oral torah of the United States where the Constitution

[02:08:36] is our written Torah and my concern is

[02:08:40] that Trump has had an effect on degrading

[02:08:45] certain expectations where it does matter how

[02:08:49] one comports oneself the president maybe not as much as some of

[02:08:52] my friends would like to think and I do think that we needed some dynamism but

[02:08:56] my concern is is that it's gonna be very difficult to recover from

[02:09:00] the kind of damage to our sense of what

[02:09:04] can and cannot be said and done not that I

[02:09:08] did think I did think that we needed to break out of our Overton

[02:09:12] Window if you will on many topics I was just the way that Trump

[02:09:15] touched those whereas not comfortable for me yes look

[02:09:19] I don't look yeah I agree there

[02:09:23] are certain ways in which President Trump does not act presidential in the

[02:09:27] way in which the previous presidents inarguable things that need it

[02:09:30] and then maybe said but then maybe there's some point where it was too much acting

[02:09:34] and the acting was counterproductive and that's that's

[02:09:38] you know it's it's it's III I think there

[02:09:42] is something extraordinary about how

[02:09:45] it was possible for someone like Donald Trump to get elected and

[02:09:49] and probably a useful question

[02:09:53] for people on both the left and the right would

[02:09:56] be to to try to think about you know what the underlying problems were with

[02:10:00] some of the solutions to that are and and you

[02:10:04] know it's you know I think I think I think the the

[02:10:08] left or the Democrats you know they could think it they can win they can win in

[02:10:12] 2020 but they have to have more of an agenda than

[02:10:15] just telling the Republicans to hurry up and die well this has to be more

[02:10:19] than that this is the thing that convinced me that I didn't get the Trump thing which

[02:10:23] was I was convinced that Trump was gonna be such a wake up

[02:10:26] call that the Democratic Party was gonna you know go

[02:10:30] behind a closed door and say we cannot let this happen again we have to look honestly

[02:10:34] at how we got beaten what this represents what it means and what we're gonna do next

[02:10:37] time and the idea that we were going to double or triple

[02:10:41] down on some of the stuff that didn't work never even occurred to me I had

[02:10:45] no idea that that party was so far gone that

[02:10:49] it couldn't actually you know if you imagine that he's orange

[02:10:53] Hitler you would think orange Hitler would be the occasion to think deeply

[02:10:57] in question hypotheses and I really had been shocked at the extent to which that

[02:11:01] didn't happen so maybe I got my own party wrong on that

[02:11:05] front I didn't know that we were this far gone but ya

[02:11:08] know it's it's I think this feels a lot of time to to

[02:11:12] do that and I keep thinking that you know

[02:11:16] we are at some point where where the distractions aren't

[02:11:20] going to work as well and I think the the the big

[02:11:23] distraction on on the left over the last 40 50 years

[02:11:27] have come in forms of identity politics where you know we we

[02:11:31] don't look at the country as a whole we look at parts of it and and

[02:11:35] sort of it on it and it's sort of been a way of you know um

[02:11:38] I think obscuring these questions of stagnation

[02:11:42] Pharaoh had a right I would say the right the

[02:11:46] right wing distraction

[02:11:50] technique has been a would say something like American exceptionalism which is interesting

[02:11:53] which is you know this doctrine that the u.s. is this

[02:11:57] singular exceptional country it's

[02:12:01] so so terrific so wonderful it does everything

[02:12:05] so incredibly well that you shouldn't ask any any difficult

[02:12:08] questions any questions at all and you know it's if you

[02:12:12] want the it's it's I think it in theological

[02:12:16] or epistemological terms you can compare it to the radical

[02:12:20] monotheism of the God of the Old Testament where um it

[02:12:23] means that God is so radically unique that

[02:12:27] you can't know anything about him you can't talk about God's attributes you

[02:12:31] can't you know say anything about him whatsoever and if the United

[02:12:35] States is radically exceptional then in a similar way you

[02:12:39] can say nothing about it whatsoever and there may be all these

[02:12:42] things on the ground that seem crazy we're you know we you know we have people who are exceptionally

[02:12:46] overweight we have we have subway systems that are exceptionally expensive

[02:12:50] to build we have universities they're exceptionally

[02:12:54] sociopathic I mean you know of the student debt problem any other country on you

[02:12:58] know we have a trade regime that's exceptionally bad for our country

[02:13:02] like no other country is self-destructive this

[02:13:05] they're all these things that we somehow don't ask us I think exceptionalism

[02:13:11] somehow led to this country that was exceptionally

[02:13:17] and strange and that's uh that's um and so you know

[02:13:20] there's you know greatness is adjacent

[02:13:24] to exceptionalism but it's actually still quite different because many

[02:13:28] countries can be great and great is more it's

[02:13:32] more a scale and there's some something you measure it against multi an area

[02:13:36] it's where as exceptional it's just completely

[02:13:39] and commensurate with anything else and and and

[02:13:43] I think that's that's gotten us into have very very bad cool to sack night

[02:13:46] I think that there's a way in which that

[02:13:50] sort of exceptionalism has ended on the right and there's been we've

[02:13:55] moved beyond that and I'm hopeful that in a similar way the

[02:13:58] left will move beyond identity politics even though you know right

[02:14:02] now it feels like the monster is flopping about more violently than ever and

[02:14:06] even though I think it might be its death throes but maybe not yeah it

[02:14:10] could be that it's gotten very strong or it could be on its last legs and it might as well go

[02:14:14] for broke yes so let me return back to

[02:14:17] the the line of inquiry I mean I'm sorry I just enjoying so

[02:14:21] much hearing what you have to say some of its new to me the

[02:14:25] the theories that might be portals into a different way

[02:14:29] of looking at the world one of them that you brought into my I've never heard

[02:14:33] it before was Gerard's various theories and

[02:14:37] I wonder if you might say you've often credited your

[02:14:41] success in business to how you understood and you applied

[02:14:44] your army obviously he didn't have this kind of level of business

[02:14:48] success so can you talk a little bit about your personal relationship

[02:14:52] to Renee Gerard's theories as a portal into a different way of seeing the world

[02:14:56] well it's a little bit about the theory so it's

[02:15:00] a it was sort of this um theory of human psychology as deeply

[02:15:04] mimetic where you sort of um you copy

[02:15:08] other people so just for the folks at home mimetic

[02:15:12] as in mime rather than me medic is in meme yes

[02:15:15] can closely relate you imitate people

[02:15:19] but you imitate that's how you learn to speak as a child you copy your parents language

[02:15:23] that's how then you also imitate desire and then

[02:15:27] there are sort of all sorts of aspects of mimesis can

[02:15:30] lead to sort of mass violence mass insanity so it has it's

[02:15:34] it's both what enables human culture to function but it also

[02:15:38] it also is is quite quite

[02:15:41] dangerous and you know when I came across the sort of constellation of ideas as

[02:15:45] an undergraduate at Stanford my my biases

[02:15:49] were sort of libertarian classic liberal you know only

[02:15:53] individuals exist individuals who radically autonomous can

[02:15:56] can think for themselves and so this was a it was both you

[02:16:01] know it was sort of a powerful corrective

[02:16:04] to that intellectually but then it also worked on an

[02:16:08] existential level where you sort of realized while there all these

[02:16:12] ways that I've been hyper mimetic I've been hyper tracked why

[02:16:15] my Stanford what does this matter so much why you know why

[02:16:19] am i doing all the things I'm doing and and and

[02:16:23] that's it's a prism through which one one looks at a lot of

[02:16:27] things that's uh that I found to be you know quite helpful over over

[02:16:31] over recent decades I think the preference falsification you can think

[02:16:35] of in mimetic terms where you know everybody goes along with what everybody

[02:16:39] else thinks and then you can get these sort of chaotic

[02:16:42] points where all of a sudden things can shift much faster

[02:16:46] than you would think possible because they're all these dynamics that are not you

[02:16:50] know not simply rational it's not quite correct to to model

[02:16:54] people as these sort of classical atoms or something like that

[02:16:58] it's more entangled do you what would be a good way

[02:17:01] for people listening at home to start to

[02:17:05] get into Gerard's philosophy if they were interested well there are you

[02:17:09] know it's there's for the number of different books that Gerard wrote

[02:17:13] I think the the Magisterial one is probably things hidden since

[02:17:17] the foundation of the world so it's this truth of mimesis

[02:17:21] and violence and the waste so it's sort of part psychology part

[02:17:24] anthropology part part history you

[02:17:28] know all portal I should point out because it's the draw hit it's

[02:17:31] you know it's a portal onto the past onto human origins

[02:17:35] it's a it's a and our history it's a portal

[02:17:39] onto the present onto the interpersonal dynamics of

[02:17:43] psychology it's uh it's um you know it's a

[02:17:47] portal onto the future in terms of you know you

[02:17:50] know are we going to let these mimetic desires run amok and

[02:17:54] head towards apocalyptic violence for you know um even

[02:17:58] the entire planet to come no longer absorb the violence that we can unleash or are

[02:18:02] we gonna learn from this and and transcend this and in a

[02:18:05] way where we we get to some some very different place and so it has it has a

[02:18:09] sense that you know both danger

[02:18:13] and and hope for the future as well so it's a it is sort of this you

[02:18:16] know panoramic theory on a lot of ways super powerful

[02:18:20] and and just extraordinarily different from

[02:18:24] from what when one would normally hear there was you know

[02:18:28] there was there's sort of like almost a cult-like element where you had you know these people

[02:18:31] who are followers of Gerard and it was sort of a sense that you

[02:18:35] know we had we had figured out the truth about the world in a way that nobody

[02:18:39] else did and that you know that that was generative and very

[02:18:42] powerful so you know it was always this parts of it that are unhealthy but but

[02:18:46] it was um you

[02:18:49] know it was it has sort of an incredible dynamism and then just

[02:18:53] you are aware that you know maybe things are so different from how how

[02:18:57] they appear to be that you know it's you know there

[02:19:01] may be a portal out there there may be you know what was shocking to me I mean the first

[02:19:05] time I heard about it you invited me to

[02:19:08] a conference that you were keeping quiet and I

[02:19:12] was in the news and there was a quite a lot of

[02:19:16] anger and furor that I had done something wrong and you

[02:19:20] waited a few days to give a talk and you talked about scapegoating

[02:19:24] and the mechanism by which violence

[02:19:28] that might be visited upon the many is visited upon the one

[02:19:31] and then you also started talking about the King as

[02:19:35] if he is sort of scapegoat in Waiting

[02:19:39] so that the king is not necessarily something that one would want to be and

[02:19:43] I found it absolutely fascinating because it turned so many ideas on

[02:19:47] their heads that I got angry at you why hadn't you told me this earlier when

[02:19:50] I'd been through three sleep sleepless nights before I'd heard the theory

[02:19:54] so I found it instantly applicable particularly if you're

[02:19:58] the sort a person who's likely to get scapegoated by not taking refuge

[02:20:02] in the herd do you think it has more relevance to people who are

[02:20:06] struggling to like break out as individuals

[02:20:09] because of the possibility of being picked off

[02:20:13] you know I I think um

[02:20:17] well I think it has Universal thinking I think it is

[02:20:20] you know oddly true yeah has some sort of Universal

[02:20:24] relevance I think the problems of violence and scapegoating are

[02:20:28] are universal problems it is um it's

[02:20:32] probably the case there are certain types

[02:20:36] of people who are more likely to become scapegoats

[02:20:39] but but it's not an absolute thing

[02:20:43] yeah and so there is you know there's always um you

[02:20:46] could say there's an arbitrariness about scapegoating because the scapegoat

[02:20:50] is supposed to represent to stand in

[02:20:54] for for everybody and so the scapegoat has to be

[02:20:57] perceived as someone who's radically other but then also has to somehow

[02:21:01] emerge from from within the group and so there are there

[02:21:04] are times when the scapegoat is the sort of outlier you

[02:21:09] know extreme insight or extreme outsider you

[02:21:12] know King slash criminal or you know whatever personality and

[02:21:16] that's that's probably a dangerous sort of thing it's like Abraham Lincoln

[02:21:20] the the incredible orator who's also grows up in a

[02:21:23] log cabin so you know these sort of extreme contrasts are often often

[02:21:27] um you know people who who are at

[02:21:31] risk of this maybe more than others and then

[02:21:35] at the same time you know because these are sort of mob-like dynamics

[02:21:39] there is sort of a way in which you know it's not like anyone's

[02:21:43] really safe from the violence right ever no one no one's completely safe

[02:21:46] I think that's quite quite true

[02:21:51] but yes it's a it's it's it's it's a yes

[02:21:55] but there's sort is a thought that one

[02:21:59] of the sort of history ideas that Gerard had that is

[02:22:03] is that is that there's a dynamic to this process

[02:22:06] where scapegoating it only works when people don't

[02:22:10] understand it and so there's sort of as you understand it

[02:22:14] better it works less well or it has to get displaced into

[02:22:17] other other dimensions and so on you

[02:22:21] know if you have a you know if you have a witch-hunt say

[02:22:24] you know we need to find a witch to bring back peace to the community that's

[02:22:29] sort of a psychosocial understanding of what you're doing is actually

[02:22:33] counterproductive the witch hunt itself you know the witch hunt is supposed

[02:22:36] to be supposed to be a theological epiphany right you know that God's telling you who

[02:22:40] the witches if you think of it as some sort of psychosocial

[02:22:43] control mechanism then they won't work anymore and so so

[02:22:47] that you know the metaphor that Gerard uses is that you

[02:22:52] know um the sacred is like phlogiston and

[02:22:56] violence is like oxygen and so you know but but

[02:23:00] it only works in a world where it's misunderstood and so if you understand

[02:23:04] scapegoating you end up in a world where it works

[02:23:08] less and less well and the kind of political and cultural institutions that

[02:23:12] are that are linked to it will will tend to unravel you

[02:23:16] know I think one of the one of the sort of on

[02:23:21] ways in which this this has happened a great deal and

[02:23:25] you know in modernity is that we we

[02:23:28] scapegoat the scapegoat or sort of go up one level that's actually

[02:23:32] and and that sort of always it makes it a little bit more complicated

[02:23:36] and so if we go after the people who were the historical

[02:23:39] oppressors the historical victimizers that's uh that's

[02:23:43] often you know that's often a super powerful way

[02:23:48] and since it's like slightly too complicated there was a there's a Bill Clinton formulation

[02:23:52] of this you know we must unite against those who seek to divide us and which

[02:23:56] is on some level itself contradictory yeah but then it's just

[02:24:00] a little bit too hard for people to fully disentangle and that's that's

[02:24:04] that's sort of one way that that I think it's still

[02:24:08] still um sort of works even though um you

[02:24:11] know it's it's again when everyone sees these moves when everyone understands them it

[02:24:15] just doesn't work that well anymore so it's like it's like it's like saying well

[02:24:19] like would you like me to prescribe you a placebo

[02:24:25] in other words that probably does not work very well it doesn't work very well it probably does not

[02:24:29] work very well and but then the other part of it that I find terrifying

[02:24:33] which is but also interesting is that implicit in this framework

[02:24:37] is that there is a minimal level of violence needed to accomplish

[02:24:40] an end and that the scapegoating mechanism well

[02:24:44] entirely unjust has the virtue of

[02:24:48] being minimal and yes that the horror is

[02:24:51] visited upon the individual yes yes or

[02:24:55] the theological terminology Gerard would use would be the scapegoating

[02:24:59] is satanic and that archaic cultures were a

[02:25:02] little bit satanic but not very and they were sort of satanic in

[02:25:06] an innocent way because the violence was actually you know

[02:25:09] a way to limit violence that that you know we

[02:25:17] violated by Allah knew I've out violence and

[02:25:20] this is this is how this is how our societies how

[02:25:25] our societies work and then it's

[02:25:28] it's it's not quite clear how things will will continue to work so there's yeah

[02:25:32] so you could always say that there's a

[02:25:36] sense in which and this is super broad brushstroke type

[02:25:39] argument there's a way in which you can say that um the

[02:25:44] left is more focused on unjust on the unjustified

[02:25:47] nature of violence and the right is more focused

[02:25:51] on how a certain amount of violence is needed for society

[02:25:55] and and there and there are ways in which um they're

[02:25:59] both right and then there ways in which they're

[02:26:03] they're both deconstructing each other I suppose you

[02:26:07] could say the nation-state a nation-state

[02:26:11] contains violence in both senses of the word contain because

[02:26:15] that's good it contains it as it limits it

[02:26:19] a channels it in certain ways well then it's also part of part

[02:26:23] of its very being and and you got into yeah all these questions

[02:26:26] when you know when it's appropriate when it's when

[02:26:30] it's not and that's why you know I I don't like violence

[02:26:34] I think you know it's a very serious problem but to also

[02:26:37] recognize hands instrumental major she said we're gonna get rid of all

[02:26:41] violence tomorrow it's gonna stop you'd be

[02:26:45] talking about nothing or I think I think so he's no way in which

[02:26:48] that can well that that might require tremendous amount of violence to enact

[02:26:52] or on or if we're gonna have no more violence

[02:26:55] at all you'll you know maybe you'll have just total chaos and a

[02:27:00] lot of violence well in that form so it's it's a it's a

[02:27:03] it's an interesting problem to ant yeah they're sort of all these interesting descriptors

[02:27:07] but then how to practically translate into action very very

[02:27:11] tricky yeah I think that one of the things on the left that

[02:27:15] people don't get right I don't know whether you'll agree with me or not is that I think

[02:27:19] we on the left are somewhat divided between two camps one

[02:27:23] camp is quite open about wanting

[02:27:27] to end depression and the other camp is cryptic about wanting

[02:27:30] to reverse it in other words you've oppressed for long enough

[02:27:34] it is your turn to be oppressed by us and we are actually envious

[02:27:38] of oppression and there is something

[02:27:42] of a civil war I mean I would say this is the way in which the IDW is left wing

[02:27:45] or left flank is misunderstood which is that almost none

[02:27:49] of the left wing members of the IDW are

[02:27:53] interested in oppressing anybody so

[02:27:58] there's no give me no payback period that that sounds like fun to us

[02:28:01] and one of the things I hadn't understood until

[02:28:05] it was said to me quite starkly if progress

[02:28:08] is messy you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet there

[02:28:12] is this just tolerance bordering

[02:28:16] on excitement about the opportunity

[02:28:20] to stick it to those who have stuck it to you from your perspective that this is

[02:28:23] an aspect of justice whereas the cessation of oppression is

[02:28:27] interesting to another part of that group yes much less yellow

[02:28:32] the disturbing thing is that it's of course much less exciting

[02:28:35] and much less energizing so I often think if you if you

[02:28:39] listen to political speech right the applause lines are always

[02:28:43] the ones we are going to go after the other side yeah we're we're

[02:28:46] gonna go after the bad people we're gonna stop them and if you try

[02:28:50] to construct a political speech in um it

[02:28:54] was we're gonna unite people we're gonna get everybody onto the skull

[02:28:58] and there were no bad people um it

[02:29:02] would be it's almost impossible to have a speech that has any energy at all

[02:29:05] well I and and and so I you know it's it's uh let

[02:29:10] me take issue with that slightly my excitement was

[02:29:13] it a political speech exactly what you said so

[02:29:17] I don't think I miss can I'm going to mischaracterize it I

[02:29:21] think that the problem is the reason I

[02:29:24] pour energy into trying to stop the political correctness

[02:29:28] and and the rules about what can be said mostly

[02:29:31] has to do with the fact that I'm incredibly excited except I'm excited about something

[02:29:36] non-political like if what I'm excited about is

[02:29:40] pursuing technological progress scientific

[02:29:43] progress more people being

[02:29:47] able to form families etc that's where the excitement is

[02:29:50] it's not coming from the politics it's coming from what the politics

[02:29:54] facilitates and so I think that the problem with these speeches is

[02:29:57] if you don't believe that there's something that we're

[02:30:01] keeping the space clean for mm-hmm we

[02:30:05] might as well riot or something because at least that's exciting and that's got

[02:30:09] some energy behind it and then it's my team versus your team but

[02:30:12] I think that would both you and I have been focus um

[02:30:16] level anybody is focused on technology as you are is a progressive

[02:30:20] in the sense of caring about what is actually progress and

[02:30:24] I think that that the danger comes from when politics

[02:30:27] becomes your entertainment and you know you read very correctly

[02:30:31] I learned this from you that when you look at a bunch of candidates debating

[02:30:35] on a crowd at a stage look at where the energy is and

[02:30:39] the energy is something that is not

[02:30:42] in my opinion a good indicator it's not a good proximate for the

[02:30:46] ultimate that I care about yes look I

[02:30:50] I'd like it to be just the way you described I I just

[02:30:54] one of the right Joey it often is not and and so

[02:30:57] yes scientific technological progress right in a way can

[02:31:01] hope as it can lead towards a more cornucopia in which

[02:31:06] there's um less Malthusian struggle less less

[02:31:10] violence um and then at the same at the very same time

[02:31:14] you know an honest account of the history these things is that you know a lot

[02:31:17] of it was used to develop or advanced weapons it

[02:31:21] was in the pursuit of violence and one sort

[02:31:25] of account of the tech stagnation the scientific tech stagnation

[02:31:29] is that you know the the breakthrough thing was the

[02:31:33] atom bomb and then you know we and then you built the rockets

[02:31:37] to deliver the bombs more quickly and by 1970

[02:31:41] we had enough bombs and rockets destroy the world ten or twenty

[02:31:44] times over or whatever and the whole thing made no

[02:31:48] more sense and and so if one of the big drivers

[02:31:51] of scientific and technological progress

[02:31:55] was um was actually just this

[02:31:59] sort of military dimension when that

[02:32:02] became absurd you know did the whole

[02:32:06] thing slow down to the Space Age and you know not in

[02:32:10] 1972 when Apollo left the moon but it was it was the key moment 1975

[02:32:14] when you had the Apollo Soyuz docking and like if we're just gonna be friends

[02:32:18] with the Russians are we does it really make sense for people working 80 hours a

[02:32:21] hundred hours a week around the clock and again I don't think

[02:32:25] it's all that but but I think one of the one

[02:32:28] of the challenges that and we should not understate how big it is in resetting

[02:32:32] Science and Technology in the 21st century is you know how

[02:32:36] do we tell a story that motivates sacrifice incredibly hard

[02:32:39] work deferred gratification for the future that's uh that's

[02:32:44] not intrinsically violent

[02:32:48] yeah and and

[02:32:52] and it was it was combined with that in in all

[02:32:55] these powerful ways well you know you so

[02:33:00] when I think about the way in which the nation let's

[02:33:04] say came around is it because I think this is this is like this is one of the reasons you know if

[02:33:07] you sort of take people you know the a lot of people

[02:33:11] deny that there's a tech science stagnation going on sure but then

[02:33:15] you know one of the other things one hears as well you know maybe

[02:33:18] it's not progressing as but do we really want it to progress this fast and isn't

[02:33:22] it dangerous and isn't it you know we're just gonna build the AI

[02:33:26] that's gonna kill everybody or it'll be you know biological weapons

[02:33:30] or it's going to be you know runaway nanotechnology or you

[02:33:34] know and and and III don't think we should you

[02:33:38] know dismiss those fears you know completely they're

[02:33:41] not completely oh the fear is that it's going to make these things cheap and easy whereas

[02:33:46] right now you you still need a state to

[02:33:49] do a lot of this work I mean you know you let the Elan musk is one of the first

[02:33:53] private individuals with a space program you know that's a version

[02:33:57] of it but I think in general it's just that that somehow

[02:34:01] you will lose control over over the violence you think

[02:34:04] you can control it maybe maybe it's a large state maybe it's you

[02:34:08] know maybe it's autonomous AI weapons which in theory are controlled by state but

[02:34:12] in practice not quite so it's yeah there's sort of all these all

[02:34:15] these scenarios where the stuff can conspire a lot of control you know I I

[02:34:19] I'm more scared of the one where nothing happens right so I'm I'm more

[02:34:23] scared of like the stagnation world I feel ultimately goes

[02:34:26] this is straight to apocalypse this is the way my much more scared of that but

[02:34:30] we have to understand why people are scared of the non

[02:34:34] stagnant world well it's a very straight I mean point they're a couple of threads

[02:34:38] here that are super important one of which is that one

[02:34:42] thing that I sense that both of us get frustrated with is that

[02:34:45] if you think about growth as necessary

[02:34:49] to contain certain violence and you

[02:34:53] think about growth is largely also being how

[02:34:57] much fossil fuels you're able to burn climate

[02:35:01] is not paired with kind

[02:35:05] of a reduction in opulence it's paired on

[02:35:09] the other side with

[02:35:13] with war and if you over

[02:35:17] focus on climate and you result

[02:35:21] in a situation in which growth is slowed to a halt now growth doesn't need

[02:35:24] to be the amount of fossil fuel you burn but it has largely been

[02:35:28] that up until the present you actually see that the trade-off

[02:35:32] that your face is very different than the one that's usually

[02:35:35] portrayed by either side and somehow we never get around

[02:35:39] to that conversation which would be if we were very serious about climate

[02:35:43] would we be plunged into war yeah obviously you

[02:35:46] can't have an economy without an environment but it

[02:35:50] may also be the case that you can't have into our environment without an economy right and

[02:35:54] and and then if both of those statements are true

[02:35:58] maybe maybe you know the set of solutions the

[02:36:02] set of best solutions looks really different than if you just focus on one and not the other

[02:36:05] so yeah it is why it's so important for me to

[02:36:09] have environments in which people who don't agree on things would agree on

[02:36:13] what constitutes a conversation can sit down with

[02:36:16] an idea that nobody's going to leave the table so

[02:36:20] but the reputation in tatters to the extent that they can't find

[02:36:24] a job on Monday to support themselves is that you have to actually

[02:36:27] weigh both of these things simultaneously and the great danger

[02:36:31] is people trying to solve either problem in isolation well

[02:36:36] you know um you know

[02:36:40] if one goes with a general climate change narrative that you know it's

[02:36:43] it's anthropogenic it's um it's the co2 levels

[02:36:47] are rising in in a way that's dangerous and has you

[02:36:50] know serious risk of some kind of big big runaway

[02:36:54] process um you know I think always the the

[02:36:58] political question my mind is on you know what do

[02:37:01] you do about China and what do you do about India because these are the countries

[02:37:05] that are you know trying to catch up to the developed

[02:37:08] world they have an enormous way to go to catch up and and

[02:37:13] you know it's a helical consequence I think Western Europe

[02:37:16] you're I think Europe has something like 8% of the carbon emissions in the

[02:37:20] world and and then and then we have to

[02:37:23] have more than just the sort of magical political thinking where it's something

[02:37:27] like you know we're gonna have a carbon tax in California and

[02:37:31] this will be so charismatic and so inspiring that people in

[02:37:34] China and India will copy us and follow suit and

[02:37:38] people aren't they're not willing to actually say that literally because it

[02:37:42] sounds so crazy um but if you say that that's not

[02:37:46] the way things actually work then then somehow you need

[02:37:49] you know you need to do some really different things we need to find energy sources

[02:37:53] that are not carbon dioxide intensive maybe we need to figure out ways

[02:37:57] to engineer carbon sinks you

[02:38:00] know the is all the sort of crazy geoengineering stuff that

[02:38:04] maybe should be on the table maybe we should be more open to to

[02:38:08] nuclear power either sort of like a range of very different debates it pushes

[02:38:12] you towards let me take a slightly different tack the

[02:38:16] two statements that I found later in life unfortunately but

[02:38:20] have both been meaningful to me one is vapors definition

[02:38:23] that a government is a monopoly on violence and and the other one

[02:38:27] it's a guy I can never remember

[02:38:31] who said I think as a French political philosopher said

[02:38:34] a nation is a group of people who have agreed to forget something

[02:38:38] in common and if you put these things together if

[02:38:42] you imagine that somehow we've now gone in for the belief

[02:38:46] the transparency is almost always a good thing and then

[02:38:50] what we need is greater transparency to control the badness in our society

[02:38:53] we probably won't be able to forget anything in common

[02:38:57] therefore we may not be able to have a nation and therefore the nation

[02:39:01] may not be able to monopolize violence which

[02:39:04] is a very disturbing but interesting causal chain can

[02:39:08] we explore the idea of transparency given that people seem to

[02:39:12] now associate certain words with positivity

[02:39:16] even though normally we would have thought about privacy transparency

[02:39:20] trade-offs let's say yes why I always do think there's a privacy

[02:39:23] transparency trade-off and and and there's

[02:39:28] it's always you know it's always a one thing is always

[02:39:31] confusing about transparency it means there's transparency in theory which

[02:39:35] is like this panopticon like thing where

[02:39:39] the entire planet gets illuminated brightly

[02:39:42] and equally everywhere all at once and and

[02:39:46] so that's in theory but then in practice it is

[02:39:49] often it sounds more like a weapon that will be directed

[02:39:54] against certain people we're on you know it's a question of who

[02:39:57] gets to render who it's transparent and

[02:40:01] who gets and maybe it's even a secret path dependent sequencing question where if you do it

[02:40:05] first for strike first strike transparency

[02:40:08] is very powerful and so you think about like you know um mr. Snowden

[02:40:12] against the NSA and then the NSA trying

[02:40:16] to expose mr. Snowden's Swedish a sex cult or whatever you

[02:40:19] want to describe it as and and I think

[02:40:23] a lot of it ends up having having that kind

[02:40:27] of an having sizes it's very Assange sorry two something yeah Assange

[02:40:31] yeah Assange is swedish sex called someone's you can see NSA NSA

[02:40:35] against Assange is swedish sex culture so bright

[02:40:38] like that and that's yeah

[02:40:42] and and and so i I think um

[02:40:46] if I think in practice um full

[02:40:50] transparency it assumes people can pay attention to everything at once

[02:40:54] or equally and that seems that seems politically incorrect

[02:40:57] then even if you had this much greater transparency in all these

[02:41:01] ways through all these ways that that would seem creepy

[02:41:05] totalitarian if we if we you know if you stated in terms

[02:41:09] of the problem of violence right you can think of the trade-off between transparency

[02:41:12] and privacy as you know transparency

[02:41:16] is you know we're looking at everybody and

[02:41:20] therefore they can't be that violent but

[02:41:24] the state may be very violent and forcing all this transparency

[02:41:28] and privacy is you know um you

[02:41:32] get to have a gun and you get to do various dangerous

[02:41:35] things in the dark and no one knows what they are and

[02:41:40] so there's probably more violence on the individual level but then

[02:41:44] less control on the state and it's again this question of you know

[02:41:47] are you more scared of the violence of individuals or more scared of

[02:41:51] centralized violence and you probably one should not

[02:41:55] be too categorical or too absolute about this but

[02:41:58] you know it can it can show up in both places and that's why it's a wickedly

[02:42:02] hard problem wickedly hard it does seem to be and I

[02:42:06] have to say I've just I've started to hate the

[02:42:09] transparency discussion because if you'll notice there's a vote in

[02:42:13] twenty 19:4 simply saying well I believe that

[02:42:17] sunlight is the best disinfectant as if that constituted

[02:42:20] an argument now first of all one thing that people don't understand

[02:42:24] is that there are infections like Brucella that are actually accelerated by someone

[02:42:28] so it's comical it's not even true bleach is probably a better disinfectant

[02:42:32] but the idea that that constitutes an argument in

[02:42:35] our time to me speaks to the fact that we're

[02:42:39] living in a very strange moment where if you if you go back to Ecclesiastes

[02:42:43] and the inspiration for turn turn turn there was

[02:42:46] an idea that there was a purpose to everything and inclusion

[02:42:51] or exclusion were both needed a time to kill a time to

[02:42:54] die time to refrain from killing there

[02:42:58] does seem to be sort of an absolutist mania in

[02:43:02] which it would be hard to imagine writing a song about

[02:43:06] a time to kill in the

[02:43:09] modern era you know and likewise I'm not positive that

[02:43:13] people recognize how imperative it is for a well-functioning government

[02:43:18] to have places where it doesn't have to constantly account for it yeah

[02:43:21] everything you know if you sort of have no backroom

[02:43:25] deals maybe that's less corrupt but maybe

[02:43:29] nothing that's functional you know it's the US Supreme Court still

[02:43:32] doesn't televise its hearings and I suspect that's

[02:43:36] that's the right call even though you know that it's there's

[02:43:40] always ends if there is something very strict and I think part of it

[02:43:43] is that you know if you know that everything is going to be transparent

[02:43:47] you will censor yourself and you won't say things so it's not like the

[02:43:51] same thing happens in a transparent way maybe just stops happening altogether

[02:43:55] if you're if you're you know if you're a politician or

[02:43:58] aspiring politician on and you you want to you

[02:44:02] know you're not going to engage in bold

[02:44:06] ideas you're not going to experiment with different different ways about thinking

[02:44:10] about things you're going to be super conventional super curated and and

[02:44:14] so it's it's not like we get you know all the benefits

[02:44:18] of transparency with none of the costs they come with you know they come with a very very

[02:44:22] high cost on and and I I

[02:44:25] do you know I I do

[02:44:29] wonder if you know one of the strange

[02:44:33] dynamics with the younger generations in the u.s. is that there's

[02:44:37] a sense that you're just constantly watch there's this you know great

[02:44:41] eye of Sauron to use the Tolkien metaphor that's looking at you at all times

[02:44:45] and you know that yeah it would be good

[02:44:48] if you could act the same way and you know something bad happened we could take care of

[02:44:52] you but if you're always being watched um I

[02:44:55] suspect it really changes your behavior you know it's interesting

[02:44:59] in a moment where I wanted to make sure that my son didn't

[02:45:03] misbehave I toured him around our neighborhood and

[02:45:07] pointed out all of the cameras that would track anybody on

[02:45:10] on the street where we live and you know you I'd never

[02:45:14] noticed them before but sure enough there they were in in in

[02:45:18] every nook and cranny that we don't realize that if it has to be stitched

[02:45:21] together there's an incredible web of surveillance

[02:45:26] tools that are surrounding us at all time let me ask you about one more theory

[02:45:29] before we break for this session we can have you on at another point it's been

[02:45:33] great talking are you familiar with the theory of

[02:45:37] Jennifer Freud's called institutional betrayal uh

[02:45:41] I know you've mentioned to me but I don't know all the details so tell me a little bit

[02:45:44] about it well I don't know all the details either but I think

[02:45:48] what she isolated was that people who have been betrayed by

[02:45:52] institutions that have a responsibility of

[02:45:56] care like a hospital for example or

[02:45:59] if you trust a sense-making organ like your newspaper

[02:46:03] and then you find that you've been betrayed by that institution

[02:46:07] that had something of a like a principal agent problem where

[02:46:11] you had to trust your agent

[02:46:15] in order to take care of you that the the quality of

[02:46:19] trauma is in fact different and that

[02:46:23] it leads to a universal fear of the infrastructure of

[02:46:27] your society that's sort of what I picked up what

[02:46:31] I was going to ask you about is given our

[02:46:35] central belief that there was something about growth

[02:46:39] that led to universal

[02:46:43] betrayal by institutions which is compromised experts

[02:46:47] in the minds of most people do you think there's

[02:46:51] a preferred way of waking

[02:46:55] up as a society out of a kind of universal

[02:46:58] institutional betrayal if we're excited about the next chapter

[02:47:02] what I'd love to talk to you about in a future episode is what we're excited about about

[02:47:05] what comes next is there a way of waking up from this

[02:47:09] most gracefully

[02:47:13] don't know don't know about that it

[02:47:16] it strikes me that there are ways we don't want to wake

[02:47:20] up and we don't want to wake

[02:47:24] up in a way where it D energizes us and

[02:47:30] demotivates and so you know so I think

[02:47:33] I think one of the one of the ways I think these institutions

[02:47:37] worked was you know they they took care of people but

[02:47:41] it was also you know motivational and you study you get good grades

[02:47:44] you'll succeed in our system right and and

[02:47:48] so one way you know when

[02:47:52] you sort of deconstruct these institutions you

[02:47:56] know there's sort of one one direction that I think is always

[02:48:00] very dangerous that it just shifts people into sort of a much more

[02:48:04] nihilistic very low-energy mode where it's just

[02:48:07] well there's no point nothing can be done and

[02:48:11] and that's the way I that's that's the that's the way

[02:48:14] that I definitively do not want to wake people up so I

[02:48:18] think it has to always be coupled a little bit to you

[02:48:22] know um yeah that these paths that aren't really going anywhere and

[02:48:26] you shouldn't go down these paths but then there's some other paths here that you

[02:48:30] take there's a portal here that you need to you need to look at and

[02:48:33] if you uh if we are just saying all the paths

[02:48:37] are blocked you know I think probably the

[02:48:41] risk is people just sit down where they are and stop moving altogether

[02:48:45] and that's that that feels like the very wrong way to wake people up that's

[02:48:49] that sounds very wise let me just ask since you have been attached

[02:48:53] to some of the highest energy ideas whether

[02:48:56] it's you know crazy sounding stuff like seasteading or

[02:49:00] radical longevity or some

[02:49:04] other ideas from your background in venture capital and

[02:49:08] as as a technologist yourself what are the things

[02:49:12] that you're most excited if we could move them back into

[02:49:16] the institutions where they probably belong to all this

[02:49:19] time what are what are the first sort of subjects

[02:49:23] and people that you would move back into institutional support

[02:49:27] to re-energize our society um

[02:49:30] people or programs

[02:49:34] well I do I do think there is

[02:49:38] something about basic science that

[02:49:42] has you know doesn't all have this sort of for-profit character

[02:49:46] someone has this nonprofit character

[02:49:50] we're building up this knowledge base for all of humanity and and

[02:49:55] and so and so I don't yet

[02:49:59] know how we do basic science without some kind of institutional context

[02:50:03] and so that's one that's that would seem you

[02:50:06] know absolutely critical you know I I'm super interested in the you

[02:50:10] know problem of longevity radical life extension and you

[02:50:14] know my my sort of disappointment in the nonprofit institutions

[02:50:18] in nonprofit world has directed me more and more over the years to just

[02:50:22] invest in biotech companies and try to find these sort of on better

[02:50:26] functioning corporate solutions and then I always have this worry in the back

[02:50:30] of my my head that maybe there are these basic research

[02:50:33] problems that they're being sidestepped because they're four to hard

[02:50:37] so I I think I think basic science is is one

[02:50:41] that that you you'd have to do and but you have to somehow

[02:50:44] also reform the institutions so you don't have this Gresham's law where the

[02:50:48] you know the politicians replace the scientists that

[02:50:51] sounds like a great wedding I was very surprised to see that your friend

[02:50:55] Aubrey de Grey who you funded to sort of get the radical on everything

[02:50:59] was in the news for having solved a hard math

[02:51:03] problem in his spare time that nobody even knew he was working on and so

[02:51:06] it seems like even though people would treat him as crazy he certainly

[02:51:10] has a lot on the ball and probably is the exactly

[02:51:14] the kind of a person who might energize a department even if you might infuriate if

[02:51:18] you can get him back in you would if you were able to get him back and I

[02:51:21] think you'd be able to solve a lot of problems well Peter it's been

[02:51:25] absolutely fantastic having you thank you for a very generous gift

[02:51:29] of your time and I hope that you will consider coming back on the portal to

[02:51:32] talk about some of the specifics about the things that you and I are most excited

[02:51:36] about doing next we'll do thank you so much all right Peter you've
