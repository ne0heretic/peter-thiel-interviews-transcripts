[00:00:01] Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience

[00:00:06] Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all

[00:00:11] day what's up man good to see you glad to be on the show my my

[00:00:14] pleasure thanks for having me my pleasure what's Kraken how you doing doing all right

[00:00:18] we were just talking about how you're still trapped in La I'm still trapped in La

[00:00:22] I know it's you're friends with a lot of people out here have you thought about

[00:00:26] uh jettison I uh I talk about it all the time

[00:00:30] and uh it's but you know it's always talk is

[00:00:34] often a substitute for action it's always does it does it lead to action or does it

[00:00:38] does it end up substituting for action and uh that's a good point but I have endless

[00:00:42] conversations about leaving I moved from San Francisco to LA back in 2018

[00:00:46] that felt uh felt about as big a move away as possible

[00:00:49] and uh I keep I keep the the extreme thing I

[00:00:53] keep saying and again I have to keep in mind talks as a substitute for Action the extreme

[00:00:57] thing I keep saying is I can't decide whether to leave the

[00:01:00] state or the country oh boy and uh if you went out of

[00:01:04] the country where would you go man I've uh it's

[00:01:08] it's it's tough to find places because uh you know there are a lot of problems in

[00:01:11] the US and most places are doing so much worse yeah so it's

[00:01:15] not a good move to leave here [ __ ] up as this place is

[00:01:18] but but I keep uh I keep I keep thinking I I shouldn't move twice so

[00:01:22] I should either I can't decide whether I should move to Florida

[00:01:26] or should move to you know New Zealand or Costa Rica or something

[00:01:29] like that yeah yeah go full John

[00:01:33] McAfee and so I but can't decide between those two so end up stuck in

[00:01:37] California well Australia is okay but

[00:01:40] they're even worse when it comes to rule of law

[00:01:44] and what they decide to make you do and the way they're cracking down on people now

[00:01:47] for online speech and it's it's very sketchy in other

[00:01:52] countries it's uh but somehow somehow

[00:01:56] the uh the the relative outperformance of the US and

[00:01:59] the absolute stagnation decline of the US they they're actually

[00:02:03] related things because uh the way the conversation's grouped

[00:02:07] every time I say tell someone you know I'm thinking about leaving the country

[00:02:10] they'll they'll do what you you say and they'll say well every place is worse

[00:02:14] and then that somehow distracts us from all the problems in this country

[00:02:18] and then we can't talk about what's what's uh what's gone wrong in the US because

[00:02:22] you know everything is uh everything's so much worse you know well I

[00:02:25] think most people know what's gone wrong but they

[00:02:29] don't know if they're on the side of the government that's currently

[00:02:32] in power they don't know how to criticize it they don't know exactly what to say what

[00:02:36] should be done right and they're ideologically connected to this

[00:02:40] group being correct right so they try to do mental gymnastics

[00:02:43] to try to support some of the things that are going on I think that's that's a

[00:02:47] part of the problem I don't think it's necessarily we don't know what the problems are we we know

[00:02:50] what the problems are but we don't have Clear Solutions

[00:02:54] as to how to fix them nor do we understand the real mechanisms of how they got there

[00:02:58] in the first place yeah I mean so

[00:03:01] there there are a lot that are that are pretty obvious to to articulate

[00:03:05] and uh they're much easier describe than than solved like we have

[00:03:08] a crazy crazy budget deficit yeah and

[00:03:12] presumably you have to do one of three things um you

[00:03:16] have to raise taxes a lot you have to cut spending a lot

[00:03:19] or um you're just going to keep borrowing money isn't there like some enormous

[00:03:23] amount of our taxes that just go to the deficit

[00:03:27] it's it's not it's not

[00:03:31] that high but it's gone up a lot and what is it what is it didn't I

[00:03:35] thought it was like 34% or something czy it peaked at 3

[00:03:38] point I want to say it peaked at 3.1% of GDP

[00:03:42] which is you know um maybe um 15

[00:03:46] 20% of the budget peed 3.1% of GDP in 1991

[00:03:50] and then it went all the way down to something like one and a half%

[00:03:54] in the mid-2010s and now it's crept back up to 3.1

[00:03:58] 3.2% and so we are at all-time highs as a percentage of

[00:04:01] GDP and the way to understand the basic math is

[00:04:05] the uh the debt went up a crazy amount but the interest rates went

[00:04:09] down and from you know 2008 to 2021 for

[00:04:12] 13 years we basically had zero interest rates with you know one

[00:04:16] brief blip under um Powell but it was basically zero rates and

[00:04:20] then you could have borrow way more money and it wouldn't show up in

[00:04:23] servicing the debt because you just paid zero% interest on the t t bills

[00:04:28] and um and the thing that's that's very dangerous

[00:04:31] seeming to me about the current fiscal situation is um

[00:04:35] the interest rates have gone back to positive like they were in the 90s and early

[00:04:39] 2000s um uh mid 2000s and um

[00:04:43] and it's just this incredibly large debt and so we now have a

[00:04:47] we now have a real runaway deficit problem but you know people have been

[00:04:50] talking about this for 40 years and uh crying wool for 40

[00:04:54] years so it's it's very hard for people to take it seriously most people don't even understand what

[00:04:57] it means like when you say there's a deficit we

[00:05:01] owe money okay to who how's that

[00:05:05] work um uh it's well it's to yeah people who

[00:05:08] who bought uh who bought the bonds and it's

[00:05:13] you know it's a lot of it's to Americans some of them are held by the Federal

[00:05:16] Reserve decent amount are held by by by foreigners at

[00:05:20] this point because uh you know it's it's it's in some ways it's the opposite

[00:05:23] of the of the um trade current account deficits the US has

[00:05:27] been running these big current account deficits and and the foreigners end up with

[00:05:31] way more dollars than they than they want to spend on American goods or services

[00:05:35] and so they have to reinvest them in the US you know some some put it into houses

[00:05:39] or stocks but a lot of it just goes into into government debt

[00:05:42] so in in some ways it's a function of the of the chronic trade imbalances

[00:05:46] chronic trade deficits well if you had supreme power

[00:05:50] if uh Peter teal was the ruler of the world and you could fix this what would you

[00:05:54] do man I always find I always find that hypothetical

[00:05:58] it's it's a ridiculous hypothetical you ridiculous hypotheticals you get ridiculous answers

[00:06:02] I want a ridiculous answer that's what I like but but

[00:06:06] what could be done like what could be done first of all what could be done to mitigate it and what could

[00:06:09] be done to solve it you know I I think I think

[00:06:13] my I think my answers are probably all in

[00:06:17] the in the you know in the in the

[00:06:21] very libertarian Direction so I it would be sort of

[00:06:24] figure out ways to have smaller governments figure out ways

[00:06:28] you know you know to um increase the age

[00:06:32] on Social Security means test Social Security so not everyone gets

[00:06:35] it just figure out ways to to gradually dial back uh

[00:06:39] you know a lot of these government benefits um

[00:06:43] and then that's you know that's insanely unpopular so it's

[00:06:47] it's completely unrealistic on that level that bothers people that need Social

[00:06:50] Security I said means tested means tested so people

[00:06:54] who don't need it don't get it right so Social Security like even if

[00:06:58] you're very wealthy I don't even know how it work Works do you still get it yeah

[00:07:01] basically anyone who pretty much everyone gets it

[00:07:05] because it was or originally um rationalized

[00:07:09] as a uh as a um as sort of a

[00:07:13] pension system not as a welfare system and so the

[00:07:16] the fiction was you pay social security taxes and

[00:07:20] then um you're entitled to get a pension out in the form of Social Security

[00:07:24] right and um and because it was uh we told this fiction

[00:07:28] that it was a form of uh there was a pension system instead of an

[00:07:31] intergenerational Ponzi scheme or something something like that

[00:07:35] um you know the fiction means everybody gets paid Social Security

[00:07:39] because it's a pension system whereas if we were more honest and said it's you know it's

[00:07:43] just a welfare system maybe you could you could start dialing

[00:07:47] uh you could you could you could probably rationalize in a lot of ways

[00:07:51] and it's it's not related to how much you put into it right

[00:07:54] like how does Social Security work in terms it's partially I think it's partially related

[00:07:58] so I think there is uh I'm not a total expert on this stuff but

[00:08:02] I think um I think there's some guaranteed minimum you get

[00:08:06] and then um and then and then if you put more in you get

[00:08:10] somewhat more and then it's it's capped at a certain amount and even

[00:08:14] that's that's why that's why Social Security taxes are capped at something

[00:08:18] like you know $150,000 a year and then

[00:08:21] this is you know this is one of the this is one of the really big tax increase proposals

[00:08:25] that's out there is to is to uncap it which would effectively be

[00:08:29] a 12 .4% income tax hike

[00:08:32] you know oh wow all your income just to Social Security

[00:08:36] sure because uh the the argument is the argu the the the sort

[00:08:39] of progressive left Democrat argument is that

[00:08:43] uh is that it's you know why should you have a regressive Social

[00:08:47] Security tax why should you pay 12.4% or whatever the

[00:08:51] Social Security tax is which half gets paid by by you

[00:08:54] half gets paid by your employer but then it it's capped at

[00:08:58] like 140 150 50k some level like that

[00:09:02] and why should be regressive where if you make 500k or a million k a year

[00:09:05] you pay zero tax on your marginal income and

[00:09:09] that makes no sense if it's a welfare program if it's a if it's a retirement

[00:09:13] Savings Program and your your payouts capped then you know if you

[00:09:17] you don't need to put in more then you get out well that's logical

[00:09:21] but there's not a lot of logic going on with the way people are talking about

[00:09:25] taxes today like California just jacked their taxes up to 14

[00:09:29] what was it 144 something like that yeah 143 I think

[00:09:32] which is maybe more yeah 149 something yeah you want more

[00:09:36] money for doing a terrible job and having more people leave for the first

[00:09:40] time ever in like the history of the state yeah but it look

[00:09:43] it it gets away with it I know and uh and so well people

[00:09:47] are forced with no choice what are you gonna do um it is

[00:09:51] it is I mean I mean there are people

[00:09:54] at the margins who leave but uh but the state government still

[00:09:58] collect it's more and more in revenues so it's you know you get I don't know you get

[00:10:02] 10% more revenues and 5% of the people leave

[00:10:07] you still you still increase the amount of revenues you're getting it's uh it's

[00:10:10] it's it's inelastic enough that you you're actually able to

[00:10:14] increase the Reven I mean this is sort of the the crazy thing about California

[00:10:18] is uh you know there there's always sort of a right-wing

[00:10:22] or libertarian critique of California that you know it's

[00:10:26] it's such a ridiculous place it it should just collapse

[00:10:30] um under its own Ridiculousness and uh it doesn't quite

[00:10:33] happen you know um the macroeconomics on it are are

[00:10:37] pretty good you know 40 million people the GDP is around four

[00:10:41] trillion it's about the same as Germany with 80 million or

[00:10:44] Japan with 125 million Japan has three times the population of

[00:10:48] California same GDP means onethird the per

[00:10:52] capita GDP so there's some level on which you know California

[00:10:55] as a whole is working even though it doesn't work from a governance

[00:10:59] point of view doesn't work for a lot of the people who live there and uh

[00:11:03] the the rough model I have for how to think of California is that

[00:11:06] it's kind of like Saudi Arabia and you have a crazy

[00:11:10] religion wokeism in California wahhabism in

[00:11:14] Saudi Arabia you know not that many people believe it but

[00:11:17] it it distorts everything and then um and then you have

[00:11:21] like oil fields in Saudi Arabia and you have the big tech companies

[00:11:25] in California and the oil pays for everything

[00:11:29] and then you have a completely bloated inefficient government

[00:11:33] sector and uh and you have sort of all sorts of distortions

[00:11:37] in the real estate market where uh people also make uh lots of money

[00:11:41] and sort of the government and real estate are ways you redistribute the oil

[00:11:44] wealth or the uh you know the the big Tech uh

[00:11:48] the big Tech money in in California and um

[00:11:52] and it's like it's it's not the way you might want to design a

[00:11:55] system from scratch but it's it's pretty stable and people been

[00:11:59] saying Saudi Arabia is ridiculous it's going to collapse any year now they've been saying

[00:12:02] that for 40 or 50 years but you know if you have a giant oil field

[00:12:06] you can pay for a lot of ridiculousness I think that's that's the way to

[00:12:10] that's that's the way you have to think of California well the other thing is you're also

[00:12:14] there things about it that are ridiculous but there's something about it that you know

[00:12:17] it um it doesn't naturally self-destruct overnight

[00:12:21] well there's a lot of Kick-Ass people there and there's a lot of people that are still generating enormous

[00:12:25] amounts of wealth there and it's too difficult to just pack up and

[00:12:28] leave yeah I think it's something like four of the

[00:12:32] eight or nine companies with Market capitalizations over a trillion

[00:12:36] dollars are based in California so it's that's amazing it's Google

[00:12:40] Apple now Nvidia

[00:12:44] meta um think yeah I think I think broadcom's

[00:12:47] close to that and there's no

[00:12:51] ideal place to live either it's not like California sucks

[00:12:55] so there's a place that's got it totally dialed in with all also that

[00:12:59] has an enormous GDP also has an enormous population all

[00:13:03] there's not like one big city that's really dialed in

[00:13:07] well it's there are there are things that that work so I looked

[00:13:11] I looked at all the zero tax states in the US

[00:13:14] and uh and it's always you don't I think the way you ask

[00:13:18] the question gets at it which is you don't live in a

[00:13:22] you know in theory a lot of stuff happens on a state level

[00:13:25] but you don't live in a state you live in a city and so um

[00:13:29] if you're somewhat biased towards living in at least a moderately

[00:13:33] sized city um okay I can

[00:13:37] there are I think there are four states where there are no cities Alaska

[00:13:41] Wyoming um South Dakota New Hampshire

[00:13:45] there's zero tax but um no cities to speak of

[00:13:49] um and then you have um then you have Washington

[00:13:52] state with Seattle where the weather is the worst in the country

[00:13:57] you have um Nevada with Las Las Vegas

[00:14:01] which I'm not that big a fan of and then that leaves three

[00:14:05] three zero tax states you have Texas which I like

[00:14:08] as a state but I'm not that big a fan of Austin Dallas or Houston

[00:14:13] and I you know it's a sort of um Houston

[00:14:17] is just sort of an oil town which is good if you're in that business but otherwise

[00:14:20] not um Dallas has sort of a inferiority

[00:14:24] complex to LA in New York you know just

[00:14:28] not not the healthiest attitude and then um you know I don't know Austin's

[00:14:32] a government town and a college town and a wannabe hipster

[00:14:36] San Francisco town so you know my my books are three strikes and you're you're

[00:14:40] kind of out too and then that leaves um that leaves

[00:14:43] Nashville Tennessee which was and then uh or Miami

[00:14:47] South Florida and those those would be my two top choices Miami's fun

[00:14:51] but I wouldn't want to live there it's a fun place to visit is a little too crazy

[00:14:55] a little too chaotic little too cocaine fueled a little too party

[00:14:59] party party I think it's I think it's pretty

[00:15:02] I think it's pretty segmented from the tourist

[00:15:07] the tourist strip from everything else it it probably is

[00:15:10] you know there probably is something a little bit paradoxical

[00:15:14] about any place that gets lots of tourists where um

[00:15:18] you know it's it's it's in some sense a Vaca there's some things that are

[00:15:22] great about because so many tourists go but then in some sense

[00:15:25] it's um it creates a weird aesthetic because

[00:15:29] uh the you know the day-to-day Vibe is that you don't you don't work and you're

[00:15:33] just having fun or something something like that right cuz so many people are going there just to do

[00:15:36] that and that's that's probably a little bit off with the south Florida

[00:15:40] the south Florida thing but um but I think it's um

[00:15:45] and then I think uh and then I think Nashville is is is

[00:15:48] also sort of its own real place Nashville's

[00:15:52] great yeah so those those would be my those are the top two I I could live in

[00:15:56] Nashville no problem yeah I'm probably always I'm always

[00:16:00] I'm always too uh you know I fifth grade

[00:16:03] onward since you know 7077 I lived in

[00:16:07] California and uh and and so I'm just

[00:16:11] a sucker for the weather and I think there is no place

[00:16:15] besides Coastal California where you have really good weather year

[00:16:19] round in the US may maybe Hawaii's pretty good Coastal

[00:16:22] California is tough to beat and um and you're two hours from the mountains and man

[00:16:26] it's like you know it's mid August here in Austin this is just it's

[00:16:30] just brutal is it I I think so really that was too hot for you

[00:16:33] it was too hot for today's mild well what is it out there like 80 all right 85

[00:16:37] 96 96 do so much sauna

[00:16:41] that I literally don't even notice it I'm outside for hours

[00:16:45] every day shooting arrows and I don't even notice it

[00:16:49] well that's uh I I don't know if you're a representative of the average a

[00:16:53] I don't know but I think you get accustomed to it to me it's

[00:16:57] so much better than too cold too cold you can die and I know you

[00:17:00] can die from the heat but you probably won't especially if you have water

[00:17:04] you'll be okay but you could die from the cold Cold's real so

[00:17:08] really cold places there's five months out of the Year where your life's in danger

[00:17:12] where you could do something wrong like if you live in Wyoming and you break down

[00:17:16] somewhere and there's no one on the road you could die out there that's

[00:17:19] real you could die from exposure sure there's probably some

[00:17:23] very deep reason there's been a net migration of people to the

[00:17:26] the west and the south in the US over California can do no wrong

[00:17:30] as long as the Earth doesn't move you're good long as there's no tsunamis

[00:17:34] you're good it is a perfect environment virtually

[00:17:37] year round it gets a little hot in the summer but again Coastal not at all

[00:17:41] if you get an 80 degree day in Malu it's unusual

[00:17:45] you know it's wonderful you got a beautiful Breeze coming off the ocean

[00:17:49] sun's out everybody's pretty and then and then it's yeah it's it's correlated

[00:17:53] with confiscatory taxation they all it's all sort of a package deal

[00:17:57] well it's a scam you know they know you don't want to leave I didn't want to leave California

[00:18:01] it's [ __ ] great I I I appreciate you left I always I always have the fantasy that if

[00:18:04] enough people like you leave it'll put pressure on them but it's it's never quite enough

[00:18:08] never quite enough and it's not going to be it's too difficult for most people it was very

[00:18:12] difficult for me and I had a bunch of people working for me that were willing to pack

[00:18:16] up and leave like young Jamie over there but we you know it was

[00:18:19] tricky you're you're taking your whole business and my business

[00:18:23] is talking to people that's part of my business my other business is standup comedy

[00:18:27] so so you left during during Co or I left at the very beginning as

[00:18:31] soon as they started locking things down I'm like oh these [ __ ] never let March April

[00:18:34] may0 in May I started looking at houses cool that's when I came

[00:18:38] to Austin first um I I

[00:18:41] end I got a place in Miami in September 2020

[00:18:45] and um and spent the last you know I've spent the last four winers there

[00:18:49] so I'm sort of always on the cusp of of uh moving to

[00:18:52] Florida hard hard to get out of California um

[00:18:56] but the the thing that's gotten a lot harder about moving relative to

[00:19:00] four years ago and you know I'd say

[00:19:04] I think my real estate purchases have generally not been not been great over the

[00:19:07] years I mean they've done okay but certainly not

[00:19:11] um not the way uh not the way I've um been able to

[00:19:15] um make money at all but uh with the one exception was Miami

[00:19:19] bought it in September 2020 and probably

[00:19:22] you know fast forward um four years it's

[00:19:26] up like 100% wow something like that

[00:19:30] and um and uh and then but

[00:19:33] then paradoxically this also means it's it's gotten much harder

[00:19:37] to move there or Austin or or any of these places

[00:19:41] you know if you um you know if if uh if I relocated

[00:19:45] my office in La um the people who own houses

[00:19:48] okay you have to you have to buy a place in Florida it costs twice as much

[00:19:53] as it did four years ago and then the interest rates have also doubled

[00:19:56] and so you get a 30-year mortgage you could have locked that in for 3% in

[00:20:00] 2020 now it's you know maybe 6

[00:20:04] and a half 7% so the prices have doubled

[00:20:08] the mortgages have doubled so it cost you four times as much to buy a house

[00:20:11] and so uh yeah so there was a moment where people could move during covid

[00:20:15] and it's it's gotten dramatically harder relative to what it was four

[00:20:19] years ago well the Austin real estate market went crazy and

[00:20:22] then it came back down a little bit it's in that down a little

[00:20:26] bit spot right now where there's a lot of like high-end properties that are still for

[00:20:30] sale they can't move it's different you know there's not a

[00:20:33] lot of people moving here now like there was in the boom cuz everything's open

[00:20:37] everywhere well I I I I I somehow think Austin was

[00:20:41] linked to California and Miami was linked a little bit more to

[00:20:45] to New York and um it was a little bit you know

[00:20:49] all these differences but um Austin was kind of

[00:20:54] you know a big part of the move where people from Tech from California

[00:20:58] that moved um moved to Austin you know there's a

[00:21:02] part of the Miami South Florida thing which was people from finance and New York

[00:21:06] uh New York City that moved um moved to to Florida

[00:21:10] and the finance industry is less networked on New York

[00:21:13] city so I think it is possible for people if you run a

[00:21:17] you know private Equity Fund or if you work at a bank it's

[00:21:21] possible for some of those functions to easily be moved to to a different state

[00:21:25] um the tech industry is cily networked

[00:21:29] on California like there's probably some way to do it it's

[00:21:33] um it's uh it's not that easy

[00:21:36] yeah it makes sense it it makes sense too it's just the sheer numbers

[00:21:41] I mean when you're talking about all those corporations that are established and based in California

[00:21:44] there's so many they're so big just the sheer numbers of

[00:21:48] human beings that live there and work there that are involved in

[00:21:52] Tech um sure but if it wasn't if it wasn't as

[00:21:56] networked you know you could you could probably just move

[00:22:00] you know and maybe these things are networked till they're not you know Detroit was

[00:22:03] very networked the car industry was super networked on Detroit for decades

[00:22:07] and decades and Michigan got more and more mismanaged and people

[00:22:10] thought the network sort of protected them because you know the big

[00:22:14] three car companies were in Detroit but then you had all the supply chains were

[00:22:18] also in Detroit and then eventually it was just so ridiculous

[00:22:22] people moved um started moving the factories outside of

[00:22:25] that area and it sort of unraveled so that's you know it can

[00:22:29] also happen with California it'll just take a lot that would be

[00:22:32] insane if they just abandon all the tech companies in California

[00:22:36] I mean just look at what happened at Flint Michigan when all the auto factories pulled

[00:22:40] out well it's it's um look I

[00:22:43] think you can it's always there all these paradoxical histories you know the the

[00:22:47] internet the point of the internet in some sense

[00:22:51] was to eliminate the tyranny of place

[00:22:55] and that was sort of the idea and then one of the paradoxes

[00:22:58] about the internet history of the internet was that the internet companies

[00:23:02] you know were you know were all you know were all centered

[00:23:06] in um in California then yeah probably there have been different

[00:23:10] different waves of um of

[00:23:13] how networked how how non- networked they were I think uh

[00:23:17] I think probably 2021

[00:23:21] uh sort of the the co moving away from California the big

[00:23:25] thing in Tech was crypto um and um

[00:23:28] and crypto um had this conceit of a you know

[00:23:32] alternate currency decentralized away from the central

[00:23:36] banks but also the crypto companies the um

[00:23:39] crypto protocols you could do those from anywhere you could do them outside the US

[00:23:43] you could do them from Miami and so crypto was something

[00:23:47] where um the tech could naturally um move out of California

[00:23:51] and and today probably the the

[00:23:55] um I don't know the core Tech narative is completely

[00:23:59] flipped to Ai and uh and if

[00:24:03] and then there's something about AI That's you know very centralized

[00:24:07] you know I always I had this one liner years ago where it was you know

[00:24:11] if if we say that crypto is libertarian can we also say that AI

[00:24:14] is communist or something like this where the you know the natural

[00:24:18] structure for an AI company looks like it's a big company

[00:24:22] and then somehow the AI stuff is uh is

[00:24:26] feels like it's going to be dominated by the the big tech companies

[00:24:30] in um in the San Francisco Bay area

[00:24:34] and so that's the future of tech yeah

[00:24:38] the um the the the scale the natural scale of the

[00:24:41] industry tells you that it's uh going to be extremely

[00:24:45] hard to get out of you know out of the San Francisco Bay Area

[00:24:49] when you look to the Future and you try to just make

[00:24:53] a just a guess as to how all this is going to turn

[00:24:57] out with AI what do you think we're looking at over the next five years

[00:25:01] man I I think I should start by being modest in answering that question

[00:25:05] saying that nobody has a clue right which is true they which pretty

[00:25:08] much all the experts say you know I I would

[00:25:14] say Let me let me do sort of a history

[00:25:17] I the Riff I always had on this was that I can't

[00:25:21] stand any of the buzzwords and I felt AI you know

[00:25:25] there's all this big data Cloud Compu Computing there

[00:25:28] were all these crazy buzzwords people had and they always were ways to

[00:25:32] sort of abstract things and get away from um

[00:25:36] from uh from reality somehow and um we're not good ways of talking

[00:25:40] about things and I thought AI was this incredible abstraction because it can mean

[00:25:44] the next generation of computers it can mean the last generation of computers

[00:25:48] it can mean anything in between and if you think about the

[00:25:51] AI discussion in the 2010s pre

[00:25:55] um open AI chat GPT and the the revolution of the last 2

[00:25:59] years but the 2010's AI discussion maybe it was

[00:26:03] so I'll start with the history before I get to the future but the history of

[00:26:06] it was it was maybe anchored on two

[00:26:10] uh two visions of what AI meant and one was um Nick

[00:26:14] Bostrom Oxford Prof who wrote This Book uh super

[00:26:18] intelligence 2014 and it was basically AI

[00:26:22] was going to be this super duper um intelligent

[00:26:26] thing way way Godlike intelligence way

[00:26:29] smarter than any any human being and

[00:26:33] um and then there was sort of the the I don't know the

[00:26:37] CCP Chinese Communist rebuttal the Kaiu

[00:26:41] Lee book from 2018 AI superpowers I think subtitle

[00:26:44] something like the race for AI between Silicon Valley

[00:26:48] and China or something like this and um it

[00:26:51] it was sort of it defined AI as it was

[00:26:55] fairly low Tech it was just surveillance um

[00:26:59] you know facial recognition technology um we would

[00:27:02] just have this sort of totalitarian stalinist

[00:27:06] monitoring it didn't require very much Innovation it just required that you apply

[00:27:10] things and basically the subtext was China is going to win because

[00:27:13] we have no ethical qualms in China about um applying

[00:27:17] this this sort of basic machine learning to uh to

[00:27:21] sort of measuring or controlling the

[00:27:24] the population and those were sort of like say two

[00:27:29] extreme um competing visions of

[00:27:33] of what AI would mean in the in the 2010s and that sort

[00:27:36] of maybe were sort of the anchors of of the AI debate

[00:27:40] and then um and then you know what what happened

[00:27:44] in some sense with um chat GPT in

[00:27:48] late 22 early 23 was um

[00:27:53] was that uh the achievement you you got

[00:27:56] you did not get super intelligence it was not just surveillance Tech

[00:28:00] but it was you you actually got to the Holy Grail

[00:28:04] of what people would have defined AI as from 1950 to

[00:28:08] 2010 for the previous 60 years before the 2010s people have

[00:28:11] always said AI the definition of AI is passing the touring test

[00:28:16] and the touring test it it basically means that the

[00:28:20] computer can fool you into thinking that it's

[00:28:23] a human being and um

[00:28:27] and um and it's a somewhat fuzzy test because you know obviously you have an expert

[00:28:30] on the computer a non-expert you know it's you know does

[00:28:34] does it fool you all the time or some of the time how good is it but to First

[00:28:38] approximation the touring test you know we weren't

[00:28:41] even close to passing it in 2021 and then

[00:28:45] you know chat GPT basically passes the touring test

[00:28:49] at least for like let's say an IQ 100 average person

[00:28:53] um it can uh it can um it's passed the touring test

[00:28:56] and that was that was the Holy Grail that was the

[00:29:00] Holy Grail of uh AI research for the previous 60 years

[00:29:04] and and so there's I know there's probably some psychological or sociological

[00:29:08] history where we can say that this weird debate between Bostrom about super

[00:29:11] intelligence and Kaiu Le about surveillance Tech

[00:29:15] was like this almost like psychological suppression people had

[00:29:19] where they were not thinking they they lost track of the touring

[00:29:23] test of the Holy Grail of because it was about to happen

[00:29:27] and it was such a significant such an important thing that you didn't

[00:29:31] even want to think about it so I'm tempted to give almost a psychological repression

[00:29:34] theory of of the 2010 debates but um

[00:29:38] be that as it may the touring test gets uh

[00:29:42] gets passed and that's yeah that's an extraordinary

[00:29:45] achievement and then you know may maybe um

[00:29:49] May and then you know where where does it go from here

[00:29:53] there probably are ways you can refi

[00:29:57] refine these it's still going to be you know a long time to

[00:30:01] apply it there is a question there's this AGI

[00:30:05] discussion you know will we get artificial general

[00:30:08] intelligence which is a hopelessly vague concept

[00:30:12] which you know general intelligence could be just a generally smart human

[00:30:15] being so is that just a person with an IQ of 130

[00:30:19] or is it super intelligence is it Godlike intelligence

[00:30:24] uh so it's sort of an ambiguous thing um but I I

[00:30:27] keep thinking that uh maybe the AGI question is less

[00:30:31] important than passing the touring test if if we got AGI

[00:30:35] if we got let's say super intelligence if we got that

[00:30:38] would be interesting to Mr God because um you'd have a competi

[00:30:42] you'd have competition for being God but um but surely

[00:30:46] the touring test is more important for us humans because

[00:30:50] it's either a complement or substitute to humans and so

[00:30:53] it's yeah it it's going to rearrange the

[00:30:57] economic cultural political structure of our society in

[00:31:01] extremely dramatic ways and and I think

[00:31:04] maybe what's already happened is much more important than anything

[00:31:08] else that's going to be done and then it's just going to be a long ways

[00:31:12] in applying it one one last thought the you know

[00:31:15] the the um the analogy

[00:31:19] I'm always tempted to go to and it's these things are never

[00:31:22] historical analogies are never perfect but it's it's that maybe

[00:31:27] Ai and 2023 24

[00:31:31] is like it's like the internet in 1999

[00:31:35] where on one level it's clear the internet's going to

[00:31:39] be big and get very a lot bigger and it's going to dominate the

[00:31:43] economy it's going to rearrange the society in the 21st century

[00:31:47] and then at the same time it was a complete bubble

[00:31:50] and um people had no idea how the business models worked

[00:31:54] um you know almost everything blew up

[00:31:58] it it took you know it didn't take that long in the scheme of things it took you know

[00:32:03] 15 20 years for it to become super dominant but

[00:32:06] uh it didn't happen sort of in 18 months as people fantasized in

[00:32:10] in 1999 and uh and maybe maybe

[00:32:14] maybe what we have in AI is is is something like this it's

[00:32:18] um figuring out how to actually apply it you know

[00:32:22] um in sort of all these different ways is going to take

[00:32:26] something like two decades but but that doesn't distract

[00:32:30] from it being a really big deal it is a really big deal and I think you're right about the

[00:32:33] during test I do you think that the lack of acknowledgement

[00:32:37] or the public celebration or at least this like mainstream

[00:32:41] discussion like which I think should be everywhere that we've passed

[00:32:45] the Turing test do you think it's connected to the fact that this stuff

[00:32:48] accelerates so rapidly that even though we've essentially breach

[00:32:52] this new territory it we still know

[00:32:56] that chp5 is is going to be better GPT 6 is going to be insane

[00:33:00] and then they're working on these right now and that and the change is happening so

[00:33:04] quickly we're almost a little reluctant to acknowledge

[00:33:08] where we're at yeah um you

[00:33:12] know I I have I've often I've you know probably

[00:33:16] for 15 years or so often been on the side that

[00:33:19] there isn't that much progress in science or Tech or

[00:33:23] not as much as Silicon Valley likes to claim and um

[00:33:27] and even on the AI level I think it's a massive technical achievement

[00:33:31] it's still an open question you know is it actually going to lead to

[00:33:35] much higher living standards for everybody you know the internet was a massive

[00:33:38] achievement how much it it raise people's living standards uh much

[00:33:42] much trickier question so um so I

[00:33:46] I I but um but in in this world where

[00:33:49] not much has happened one of the paradoxes

[00:33:53] of a of an era of relative Tech stagnation

[00:33:57] um is that when something does happen we don't even know how to process

[00:34:00] it so you know I think I think Bitcoin was a i

[00:34:04] it was a big invention we can debate with it was good or bad but it was a pretty big deal

[00:34:08] and it was um systematically underestimated

[00:34:12] for at least you know the first uh um

[00:34:16] 10 11 years and you know you could you could trade it

[00:34:20] it went up smoothly for 10 11 years it didn't get repriced all at once

[00:34:24] because uh we're in a world where nothing big ever happens

[00:34:28] and um and so we we have no way of processing it when something

[00:34:31] pretty big happens the internet was pretty big in 99 Bitcoin

[00:34:35] was moderately big internet was really big Bitcoin was moderately

[00:34:39] big and I'd say um passing the Turing test is

[00:34:42] really big it's on the same scale as the internet and uh

[00:34:46] and because our our lived experien is that so

[00:34:50] little has felt like it's been changing for the

[00:34:54] last few decades we're we're probably underestimating it it's interesting the

[00:34:57] say that so little we feel like so little has changed CU

[00:35:01] if you're a person how old are you um same age as you were

[00:35:05] born 1967 so in our age we've seen all the change

[00:35:09] right we saw the uh end of the Cold War we saw answering

[00:35:12] machines we saw VHS tapes then we saw the internet and then

[00:35:17] where we're at right now which is like this bizarre moment

[00:35:20] in time where people carry the internet around with them in their pocket every day

[00:35:24] and these super sophisticated computers that are ubiquitous everybody has

[00:35:28] one there's incredible technology that's being ramped up

[00:35:31] every year they're getting better all the time and now there's AI there's AI

[00:35:35] on your phone you could access chat GPT and a bunch of different programs

[00:35:39] on your phone and I think that's an insane change

[00:35:43] I I think that that's one of the most especially with the use of social media

[00:35:47] it's one of the most bizarre changes I think our culture is ever

[00:35:51] the most it can be it can be a big change culturally

[00:35:55] or or politically um but uh

[00:35:59] the yeah the kinds of questions I I'd ask is how do you measure it economically

[00:36:03] does it how much does it change GDP how much do it change

[00:36:07] productivity um and um

[00:36:10] and certainly um the story I I would

[00:36:14] generally tell for the last 50 years since the 1970s

[00:36:19] early 70s is that we've been not absolute stagnation

[00:36:22] we in an era of relative stagnation where there has been

[00:36:26] um very limited progress in the world of atoms

[00:36:30] the world of physical things um um and

[00:36:33] uh there has been um a lot of progress in the world of bits

[00:36:38] information computers internet mobile internet

[00:36:42] you know now now ai what are you referring to when you're saying the the world of physical things

[00:36:46] um you know it's any um it's

[00:36:50] well if we had defined technology if we were sitting here in

[00:36:54] 1967 the year we were born and had a discussion

[00:36:58] about technology what technology would have meant would it would have

[00:37:01] meant computers it would have also meant Rockets it would meant supersonic

[00:37:06] airplanes it would have meant um new medicines

[00:37:10] it would have meant the Green Revolution in agriculture maybe

[00:37:13] underwater cities um you know

[00:37:17] it it sort of had BEC and it because technology

[00:37:21] simply gets defined as that which is changing that which is progressing and

[00:37:24] so there's progress on all these fronts T today last 20

[00:37:28] years when you talk about technology you're normally just talking about information

[00:37:32] technology technology has been reduced to meaning computers

[00:37:36] and that tells you that the structure of progress has been weird

[00:37:39] there's been this narrow cone a very intense progress

[00:37:43] around the world of bits around the world of computers and then all the other

[00:37:47] areas have been relatively stagnant we're not moving any faster

[00:37:51] you know the Concord got decommissioned in 2003 or

[00:37:55] whenever um and then with all the low Tech airport security

[00:37:58] measures it takes even longer to fly to get through all all of them

[00:38:02] from from from one city to the next you know the highways have gone backwards

[00:38:05] because they're more traffic jams we haven't figured out ways around those so they're sort of

[00:38:09] we're literally moving slower than we were 40 or 50 years

[00:38:13] ago um and um and then

[00:38:17] yeah some uh and that's that's sort of the uh that's sort

[00:38:20] of the um and then you know the and then of

[00:38:24] course um there's also a sense in which uh these

[00:38:28] the screens and the devices you know have have this effect distracting

[00:38:32] us from this so you know when you're you know riding a 100 year old

[00:38:35] Subway New York City and you're looking at your iPhone

[00:38:39] you can you can look at wow this is this cool new Gadget

[00:38:43] but you're also being distracted from the fact that your lived

[00:38:46] environment hasn't changed you know in a 100 years and

[00:38:50] and and so there's yeah there's a question how important

[00:38:54] is this world of bits versus versus the world of ad Adams

[00:38:58] you know I would say as human beings we're physically embodied in

[00:39:01] a material world and so I I I would always say this world of atams

[00:39:05] is pretty important and when that's pretty stagnant

[00:39:09] you know there's a lot of stuff that that doesn't make sense I I was an undergraduate at

[00:39:12] Stanford late 80s and at the time

[00:39:16] um in retrospect every engineering area

[00:39:20] would have been a bad thing to go into you know mechanical

[00:39:23] engineering chemical engineering all these engineering skills

[00:39:27] where you were tinkering and trying to do new things because these things turned out to be stuck

[00:39:31] they were regulated couldn't come up with new things to do nuclear

[00:39:34] engineering Aero Astro engineering people already knew those were really bad

[00:39:38] ones to go into they were you know outlawed you weren't going to make any progress in new

[00:39:42] nuclear reactor designs or stuff like that

[00:39:45] um electrical engineering which was the one that's sort of adjacent to making

[00:39:49] semiconductors that one was still okay and then the

[00:39:53] only field that uh was actually going to progress

[00:39:56] a lot was computer science and um and again

[00:40:00] you know it's it's been very powerful but that was not the felt

[00:40:04] sense in the 1980s in the 1980s computer science

[00:40:07] was this ridiculous inferior subject

[00:40:12] um you know I I always the the linguistic cut is always

[00:40:16] when when people use the word science I'm in favor of science I'm not in favor of

[00:40:19] Science and quotes and when it's always a tell

[00:40:23] that it's not real science and so when we call it climate science or

[00:40:27] political science or social science um you know you're

[00:40:31] just sort of making it up and you have an inferiority complex to real science

[00:40:34] which something physics or chemistry and computer science was in the same

[00:40:38] category as social science or political science it was it was a

[00:40:42] fake field for people who found electrical engineering or

[00:40:45] math way too hard and um um

[00:40:49] and and sort of dropped out of out of the real the real science and

[00:40:53] real um real engineering Fields you don't feel that climate science is a real

[00:40:56] science it's it

[00:41:00] is um

[00:41:04] it's it's um

[00:41:08] well let me it's i i i

[00:41:12] there's several different things one could say it's uh

[00:41:16] it's possible climate change is happening it's possible

[00:41:20] we don't have great accounts of why that's going on so I'm not I'm not questioning any

[00:41:23] of those things but uh but how scientific

[00:41:27] it is um I I don't think um

[00:41:31] I don't think it's it's a place where we have really vigorous debates you know

[00:41:34] maybe the climate is increasing because of carbon dioxide emissions temperatures are

[00:41:38] going up maybe it's methane maybe it's people are eating too much steak it's

[00:41:41] the cows flatulating or and you have to measure you how how much is methane

[00:41:45] a greenhouse gas versus versus carbon dioxide I don't think

[00:41:49] they're I don't think they're rigorously doing that stuff scientifically and I

[00:41:52] think the fact that it's called climate science tells

[00:41:56] you that it's more dogmatic than than than anything that's

[00:42:00] truly science should be why doesn't Dogma doesn't mean it's wrong

[00:42:04] but but why is the fact that it's called climate science mean that it's more dogmatic

[00:42:07] because if you said nuclear science you wouldn't question it right it's yeah but

[00:42:11] no one calls it nuclear science they call it nuclear engineering because I'm just

[00:42:15] the only the only thing is I just making I'm just making neing science that

[00:42:19] is legitimately science well this point people say computer science

[00:42:22] has worked but right in the 1980s all I'm saying

[00:42:26] is it was in the same categories let's say social science political science it was it

[00:42:29] was a it was a tell that the people doing it kind of deep

[00:42:33] down knew they they weren't doing real science well there's certainly ideology

[00:42:37] that's connected to climate science and then there's certainly corporations

[00:42:41] that are invested in this uh this Prospect of green energy

[00:42:45] and the concept of green energy and they're profiting off of it and

[00:42:49] pushing these different things whether it be electric

[00:42:53] car mandates or whatever it is like California I think they it's 30

[00:42:56] 20 35 they have a mandate that all new vehicles have to be

[00:43:00] electric which is hilarious when you're connected to a grid that can't support the

[00:43:04] electric cars it currently has after they said

[00:43:07] that within a month or two Gavin new asked people

[00:43:11] to not charge their Teslas because it was summer and the grid

[00:43:15] was [ __ ] yeah look it's it it it was all linked into all

[00:43:18] these ideological projects in all these ways and

[00:43:22] uh there you know there's there's an environmental

[00:43:26] project which is you know and and maybe maybe it shouldn't be

[00:43:30] scientific you know there's you know the hardcore environmentalist argument is we only have

[00:43:33] one planet and we don't have time to do science if we if we have

[00:43:37] to do rigorous science and you can prove that we're overheating it'll

[00:43:40] be too late and um and so if you're a hardcore environmentalist

[00:43:45] you know you don't want to have as high a standard of science yeah my

[00:43:48] my intuition is certainly when when you go away from that you end

[00:43:52] up with things that are too dogmatic too ideological may maybe it doesn't

[00:43:55] even work even if the planet's getting warmer you know maybe

[00:43:59] climate science is is not like my my question is is car like maybe

[00:44:03] methane is a worse um is is is

[00:44:06] it more dangerous greenhouse gas than uh carbon dioxide

[00:44:10] we're not we're not even capable of measuring that well we're also

[00:44:14] ignoring certain things like regenerative Farms that sequester

[00:44:18] carbon that and then you have people like Bill Gate saying that planting

[00:44:22] trees to deal with carbon is ridiculous it's a ridiculous way to do it like

[00:44:26] how is that ridiculous is they literally turn carbon dioxide

[00:44:30] into oxygen it is their food their food that's what the food

[00:44:33] of plants is that's that's what powers the the whole

[00:44:37] plant life and the way we have the symbiotic relationship with them like

[00:44:41] and the more carbon dioxide is the greener it is which is why

[00:44:44] it's Greener Today on Earth than it has been in a hundred years

[00:44:48] sure these are all facts that are inconvenient to people

[00:44:52] that have a very specific narrow window of how to

[00:44:55] approach this sure although you know there probably are ways to steal man

[00:44:59] the other side too where um where maybe

[00:45:03] maybe um you know the the original 1970s

[00:45:07] you know I think the manifesto that's always very interesting

[00:45:11] from the other side was this uh book by the club of Rome 1972

[00:45:15] the limits of growth and it's you can't have you

[00:45:19] we need to head towards a society in which there's zero%

[00:45:23] there's very limited growth because if you have unlimited growth

[00:45:27] you're going to run out of resources if you don't run out of resources you'll

[00:45:30] hit a pollution constraint but the um in the 1970s

[00:45:34] it was um you're going to have overpopulation um you're going to run

[00:45:38] out of oil we had the oil shocks um and then

[00:45:42] um and then by the 90s it it sort of morphed into

[00:45:45] more of the pollution problem with uh with carbon dioxide climate

[00:45:49] change other other environmental things but uh but there is sort of

[00:45:53] um you know it's you know there's been some

[00:45:57] you know some improvement in in oil carbon fuels with fracking

[00:46:01] things like this in Texas it's um it's not at the scale

[00:46:05] that's been enough to uh um you know

[00:46:09] give an American standard of living to the whole planet and we consume a 100 million

[00:46:13] barrels um of oil um you a

[00:46:17] day globally um maybe fracking can add

[00:46:20] 10% 10 million to that if everybody on this planet has an

[00:46:24] American standard of living it's something like three 300

[00:46:27] 400 million barrels of oil and I don't I don't think that's there

[00:46:31] so that's that's kind of I I always

[00:46:35] wonder whether that was the that was the real environmental

[00:46:38] argument is we can't have an American standard of living for the whole planet

[00:46:42] we somehow can't justify this degree of

[00:46:46] inequality and um and therefore you know we have to

[00:46:50] figure out ways to dial back and you know tax the

[00:46:54] carbon restrict it and uh and maybe you know

[00:46:57] maybe that's there's some sort of a malthusian

[00:47:01] calculus that's more about resources than about

[00:47:05] pollution um how much of that could the the the demand

[00:47:09] for oil could be mitigated by

[00:47:13] nuclear uh it you Pro

[00:47:16] you probably could mitigate it a lot there's

[00:47:20] there's a question why the why the nuclear thing has

[00:47:23] gone so wrong it's um especially if you if you have El Vehicles

[00:47:27] right you know it's uh um combustion engine is probably

[00:47:31] hard to get nuclear to work but if you um if you shift to electric vehicles

[00:47:35] you can you can charge them you know your Tesla cars at night um

[00:47:39] and that that would seemingly work um and there's

[00:47:43] definitely yeah there's definitely a history of energy where it was always

[00:47:47] in the direction of you know more intense use it

[00:47:50] went from wood to Coal to oil which is a

[00:47:54] more compact form of energy and in a way takes up less of the

[00:47:57] environment and then if we move from oil to uranium that's even

[00:48:01] you know it it's even smaller and so in a sense

[00:48:05] the smaller the more dense the energy is the

[00:48:09] less of the environment it takes up and when we go back

[00:48:12] when we go from oil to natural gas which takes up more space

[00:48:16] and from natural gas to solar or wind we have to you know you have to pollute

[00:48:20] the whole environment by putting up windmills everywhere or you have to you know

[00:48:24] you know you have to cover the whole desert with solar pan that is a good way to look

[00:48:28] at it it is a form of pollution and so um and so

[00:48:31] there was a way there was a way that nuclear was supposed to be the

[00:48:35] uh the the energy mode of the the 21st century

[00:48:39] and then yeah there there all these there these historical questions

[00:48:42] why did it why did it get stopped why did we not uh why

[00:48:46] did we not go down that route the um

[00:48:50] you know the the standard explanation of

[00:48:53] why it stopped um was

[00:48:57] that uh it was um there were all these dangers we had three mile on

[00:49:01] 1979 you know Chernobyl and um

[00:49:05] in 1986 and then the Fukushima one in Japan I think

[00:49:09] 2011 and uh you had these sort of you had these various act

[00:49:13] accidents um my alternate theory on why

[00:49:17] uh why nuclear energy really stopped is that

[00:49:21] it um it was um it was sort of

[00:49:24] dystopian or even apocalypse itic because it turned out that

[00:49:28] it was all um it turned out to be very dual use if you

[00:49:32] build nuclear power plants um

[00:49:36] uh it's it's only sort of one step away from uh building

[00:49:40] nuclear weapons and uh

[00:49:44] and it turned out to be a lot trickier to u to

[00:49:47] separate those two things out than it looked and I think the you know the signature

[00:49:51] moment was 1974 or 75 when India gets

[00:49:54] the nuclear bomb and I the US I believe had transferred

[00:49:58] the nuclear reactor technology to India we thought they couldn't weaponize

[00:50:02] it and then it turned out it was pretty easy to weaponize

[00:50:06] and then the and then sort of the geopolitical problem

[00:50:10] with uh with nuclear power was you either

[00:50:14] you know um you need a double standard

[00:50:18] where we have nuclear power in the us but we don't allow other countries

[00:50:22] to have nuclear power because the US gets to keep its

[00:50:25] nuclear weapons we don't let 100 other countries have nuclear weapons

[00:50:29] and this that's an extreme double standard probably a little

[00:50:33] bit hard to justify um or

[00:50:36] um or you need some kind of really

[00:50:40] effective Global governance where you have a one world

[00:50:44] government that regulates all this stuff which doesn't sound that good

[00:50:48] either and uh and then sort of the compromise

[00:50:52] was just to um to um regulate it

[00:50:56] so much that uh you know maybe the the nuclear plants got

[00:50:59] grandfathered in but it became too expensive to build new ones

[00:51:03] Jesus like even China which is the country where they're building

[00:51:07] the most nuclear power plants they've built way less

[00:51:11] than people expected a decade ago because um

[00:51:14] you know they they don't trust they don't trust their own designs

[00:51:18] and so they have to copy the over safety overprotected

[00:51:22] designs from the west and the nuclear plants nuclear power costs too

[00:51:25] much money it's cheaper to do coal

[00:51:29] wow so um so you know I'm not get the numbers exactly right

[00:51:33] but if you look at what percent of Chinese electricity was

[00:51:36] nuclear it wasn't that high it was like maybe four five% in 2013

[00:51:41] 2014 and the percent hasn't gone up in 10 years

[00:51:44] because you know they maybe doubled the amount of electricity they Ed maybe they doubled

[00:51:48] the nuclear but the relative percentage is still it's still a pretty

[00:51:51] small part of the mix because it's just more expensive when you

[00:51:55] have these you over safety designed reactors there probably ways

[00:51:59] to build small reactors um that that that are

[00:52:03] that are way cheaper but then you still have this you still have this dual use

[00:52:07] thing you know do do you create plutonium do you you know are

[00:52:10] are there ways you can create a pathway to building more nuclear

[00:52:14] weapons and if there was Innovation if nuclear

[00:52:18] engineering had gotten to a point where you know let's

[00:52:22] say there wasn't Three Mile Island or Chernobyl didn't happen do you

[00:52:25] think that it would have gotten to a much more efficient and

[00:52:30] much more effective version by now well my my understanding is there are

[00:52:33] we we have way we have way more efficient designs we have small

[00:52:37] you you can do small reactor designs which which are you don't

[00:52:41] need this giant containment structure so it costs much less per kilowatt

[00:52:44] hour of of electricity you produce so I I think we have

[00:52:48] those designs they're they're just not allowed and then

[00:52:52] but then I think the problem is that um

[00:52:56] if you were able to build them in all these countries all over the world you still

[00:52:59] have this dual use problem right and again my alternate history of what

[00:53:03] really went wrong with nuclear power it wasn't three mland it wasn't Chernobyl

[00:53:07] that's the that's the official story the real story was India

[00:53:10] getting the bomb wow that makes sense that

[00:53:14] completely makes sense gez Louise and then this is

[00:53:18] you know this is always you know this is always the question about uh

[00:53:22] um there's always a big picture question

[00:53:25] people ask me you know uh you know if I'm right about

[00:53:29] this picture of you know this slowdown in Tech this the sort of stagnation

[00:53:33] in many many dimensions and then there's always a question you know

[00:53:37] wh why did this happen and um and my copout

[00:53:40] answer is always uh why questions are overdetermined

[00:53:44] um because you know um it can be there are

[00:53:48] multiple reasons and so it could be why could be we became a more

[00:53:51] feminized risk-averse Society could be that uh the education

[00:53:55] system worked less well could be that we were just out of ideas

[00:53:59] the easy ideas have been found the hard ideas the cupboard Nature's

[00:54:02] cupboard was Bare the low hanging fruit had been picked so that it can be

[00:54:06] overdetermined but I think I think one dimension

[00:54:10] that's not to be underrated for the Science and

[00:54:13] Tech stagnation was that uh an

[00:54:17] awful lot of Science and Technology had this

[00:54:21] dystopian or apocalyptic uh Dimension and

[00:54:25] uh and probably what happened at you know Los Alamos in 1945

[00:54:29] and then uh with with the thermonuclear weapons in the early 50s

[00:54:33] um it took a while for it to really seep in but it had this

[00:54:37] sort of delayed effect where you know maybe

[00:54:41] maybe a a stagnant World in which the physicists don't

[00:54:45] get to do anything and they have to putter around with Dei

[00:54:48] and um you're not you know um but

[00:54:52] uh you don't build weapons that blow up the world anymore you

[00:54:56] know is that a is that a feature or a bug and so the stagnation was

[00:54:59] sort of was sort of like this this response and

[00:55:03] so it sucks that we've lived in this world for 50 years where

[00:55:06] a lot of stuff has been inert but um

[00:55:10] if we had a world that was still accelerating on all these Dimensions

[00:55:14] with SuperSonics and Hypersonic planes and Hypersonic

[00:55:18] weapons and you know modular nuclear reactors

[00:55:21] maybe we wouldn't be sitting here and the whole world would have already blown up and so we're we're in that

[00:55:26] we're in the stagnant path of the Multiverse because it had

[00:55:29] it had this partially protective thing even though in all these other ways I feel

[00:55:33] it's it's it's deeply deranged our society that's a very interesting

[00:55:37] perspective and it makes a lot of sense it really does and

[00:55:40] particularly the Dual use thing with nuclear power and

[00:55:44] especially Distributing that to other countries when you talk about the stagnation

[00:55:48] in this country like I don't know how much you follow

[00:55:51] this whole UAP nonsense I know we met what was that guy's name at your

[00:55:55] place the uh the guy who did Chariots of the Gods

[00:55:59] oh fond Anakin yes yeah yeah you you you didn't you thought

[00:56:02] he was too crazy you you like Hancock but you don't like fond danin

[00:56:06] H I didn't think he's too crazy he just willfully

[00:56:10] in my opinion ignores evidence that

[00:56:13] would show that some of the things that he's saying have already been

[00:56:17] solved and I think his

[00:56:22] his hypothesis is all related

[00:56:25] to this concept that we have been visited and that

[00:56:29] that's how all these things were built and that this technology was

[00:56:33] brought here from another world and I think he's very

[00:56:37] ideologically locked into these ideas and I think a

[00:56:40] much more compelling idea is that there were

[00:56:44] very Advanced cultures for some reason 10,000

[00:56:48] years ago whatever it was whatever the year was where they they

[00:56:52] built some of the insane structures it's a 45

[00:56:57] 100 years ago they roughly think the pyramids were built like what whatever

[00:57:01] the [ __ ] was going on there I think those were human beings

[00:57:04] I think those were human beings in that place in that time and I

[00:57:08] think they had some sort of very sophisticated technology that was lost

[00:57:12] and things can get lost things can get lost in cataclysms

[00:57:15] things can get lost in they can get lost in disease

[00:57:19] and famine and all there's all sorts of War all sorts of reasons

[00:57:23] the burning of the Library of Alexandria there's all sorts of ways that technology

[00:57:27] gets lost forever and you can have today someone

[00:57:31] living in Los Angeles in the most sophisticated high-tech Society

[00:57:34] the world has ever known while you still have people that live in

[00:57:38] the Amazon that live in the same way that they've lived for thousands

[00:57:42] of years so those things can happen in the same Planet

[00:57:45] at the same time and I think while the rest of the world was

[00:57:49] essentially operating at a much lower vibration there were people in Egypt

[00:57:53] that were doing some extraordinary things um I don't know

[00:57:57] how they got the information maybe they did get it from visitors maybe they did

[00:58:00] but there's no real compelling evidence that they did

[00:58:04] I think there's much more compelling evidence that a cataclysm happened

[00:58:08] um when you look at the younger dras impact Theory it's all entirely based

[00:58:12] on science it's entirely based on core samples and meridium content

[00:58:16] and and also massive changes in the environment

[00:58:19] over a very short period of time particularly the melting of the ice

[00:58:23] caps in North America and just craters

[00:58:26] all around the world that we know something happened roughly

[00:58:30] 11,000 years ago and probably again 10,000

[00:58:34] years ago I think it's a regular occurrence on this

[00:58:37] planet that things go sideways and there's massive natural disasters

[00:58:41] and I think that it's yeah there there's the Bron age

[00:58:45] civilization collapse somewhere in the mid 12th century BC

[00:58:49] and um and probably the um

[00:58:53] you know in some ways the the one in which we have the best history is the fall of the Roman

[00:58:57] Empire which was obviously sure the culmination of

[00:59:00] the classical world and uh it somehow it's somehow

[00:59:05] extreme extremely unravel so my yeah I think I think my my

[00:59:08] view on it is probably somewhere between

[00:59:12] yours and the um the fond Anakin

[00:59:16] no not fond Anakin I'm more on the uh more on the

[00:59:19] more on the uh Pro uh the

[00:59:23] other side let me let me let me try to Define

[00:59:27] why this agree on why this is so important

[00:59:30] today this is not just of antiquarian interest and the reason it matters

[00:59:34] today is because the alternative you know if if if

[00:59:38] if you say civilization has seen great

[00:59:42] Rises and Falls it's gone through these great Cycles

[00:59:45] um you know may maybe the Bronze Age civilizations

[00:59:49] were very Advanced but someone came up with iron weapons so there was just one dimension

[00:59:53] where they progressed but then everything else they could destroy and so

[00:59:57] um uh or you know the fall of the Roman Empire was

[01:00:00] again this you know pretty cataclysmic thing where

[01:00:04] there were diseases and you know and then there were political

[01:00:08] things that unraveled but uh somehow you know was

[01:00:11] was a massive regression for you know four five 600

[01:00:15] years into the into the Dark Ages and um

[01:00:19] the um the the sort of naive

[01:00:24] the progressive things always just got monotonically

[01:00:28] better and there's sort of this revisionist purely Progressive

[01:00:32] history where even the Roman Empire didn't Decline and even

[01:00:36] you know this one one one sort of stupid way to quantify

[01:00:39] this stuff is with pure demographics and so it's

[01:00:43] the question how many people lived in the past

[01:00:47] and um and the Rises and Falls of civilization

[01:00:51] story is there were more people who lived in the Roman Empire

[01:00:54] because it was more advanced it could support a larger population

[01:00:58] and then the population decline you know city of Rome maybe had a million people

[01:01:02] at its peak and then by you know I don't know 650

[01:01:05] ad it's maybe it's down to 10,000 people or less

[01:01:09] you have this complete collapse in population and then

[01:01:13] um and then the the sort of alternate purely

[01:01:16] Progressive view is the population has always just been monotonically

[01:01:20] increasing because it's a measure of how in some sense things

[01:01:24] in aggregate have have always been getting better so I am

[01:01:27] I am definitely on your side that population

[01:01:31] had great Rises and Falls civilizations had great Rises

[01:01:35] and Falls um um and so that part of

[01:01:38] it I I I agree with you or even

[01:01:42] you know some variant of what Hancock or fundana

[01:01:45] can say uh the

[01:01:49] the the place where I would say I think things are different

[01:01:53] is I don't think I don't think

[01:01:57] um and and and and and therefore it seems possible something

[01:02:00] could happen to our civilization that's that's always the upshot of it if if it had

[01:02:04] been monotonically always progressing then there's nothing we should

[01:02:07] worry about nothing can possibly go wrong and then certainly

[01:02:12] certainly the thing um the the the sort

[01:02:15] of alternate Hancock fond danin um

[01:02:20] Joe Rogan history of the world uh tells us is that

[01:02:23] uh we shouldn't take our civilization for granted there's there things that

[01:02:27] can go really hawi I I agree with that the one place

[01:02:30] where I I is I think I do think our

[01:02:34] civilization today is on some Dimensions way more advanced

[01:02:38] than any of these past civilizations were I don't think any of them had

[01:02:42] nuclear weapons I don't think any of them had

[01:02:45] um you know spaceships

[01:02:50] um or or anything like that and

[01:02:54] uh and so the failure mode is likely to be

[01:02:58] be be somewhat different from from these These past ones

[01:03:02] yeah that makes sense um I think uh technology

[01:03:05] progressed in a different direction that's what I think I think

[01:03:09] it structural Technology Building Technology had somehow or another achieved

[01:03:13] levels of competence that's not available today

[01:03:17] when you look at the construction of the great perment of Giza there's 2,300,000

[01:03:21] stones in it there the whole thing points to

[01:03:25] do north south east and west it's an incredible achievement

[01:03:29] the the stones some of them were moved from a quarry that was 500 miles

[01:03:33] away through the mountains they have no idea how they did it massive Stones the ones inside

[01:03:36] the king's chamber where they like the biggest ones are like 80 tons it's crazy

[01:03:40] the whole thing's crazy like how did they do that like whatever they did

[01:03:44] they did without machine supposedly they did without um the

[01:03:47] the use of uh the combustion engine they didn't have electricity

[01:03:52] and yet they were able to do something that stands the test of time not just

[01:03:56] so you could look at it you know like you can go to the Acropolis

[01:04:00] and see the Parthenon it's gorgeous it's it's amazing it's incredible

[01:04:04] but I can understand how people could have built it the pyramids

[01:04:07] is one of those things you just look at you go what the [ __ ] was going on here

[01:04:11] what was going on here and none of these people are still around you you have

[01:04:15] this strange culture now that's entirely based around you know

[01:04:18] you have Cairo and an enormous population

[01:04:22] of visitors right which is a lot of it people just going to St these

[01:04:26] relics what what was going that those people

[01:04:30] were so much more advanced than anyone anywhere else in the world

[01:04:34] yeah I would I I I'm not sure I would anchor on the technological part but

[01:04:37] I think I think the the piece that is very hard for us to comprehend

[01:04:41] is what motivated them culturally well how did they do it physically

[01:04:45] why why did they do it why why were you motiv so why but also

[01:04:49] how how is a big one because that it's really difficult

[01:04:52] to solve there's no traditional conven explanations

[01:04:57] for the construction the movement of the stones the amount of time that it would taken

[01:05:00] if you move 10 stones a day I believe it takes 664 years

[01:05:04] to make one of those pyramids so how many people were involved how long did it

[01:05:07] take how'd they get them there how' they figure out how to do it how come the shittier

[01:05:11] pyramids seem to be dated later like what what was going

[01:05:15] on in that particular period of time where they figured out how to do

[01:05:19] something so extraordinary that even today

[01:05:22] 4,500 years later we stare at it and we go

[01:05:26] I don't know I don't know what the [ __ ] they did I I haven't studied it carefully

[01:05:30] enough I'll I'll Trust you that it's very hard I think the the

[01:05:33] I think the I would say the the real mystery is why were they

[01:05:37] motivated and it's because you can't live in a pyramid it's just

[01:05:41] it was just the afterlife of the Pharaoh there's some debate about that

[01:05:44] Christopher Dunn as an engineer who believes that it was some sort of a power plant he's

[01:05:48] got this very bizarre theory that there was a chamber that exists

[01:05:52] if you can see you see the structure of the pyramid the inside of it there's a chamber that's

[01:05:56] Subterranean and he believes this Subterranean chamber was

[01:05:59] pounding on the surface of the of the earth

[01:06:03] and of the walls of the thing creating this very specific vibration

[01:06:07] they had shafts that came down into the Queen's chamber these

[01:06:11] shafts they would pour chemicals into these shafts and then there was

[01:06:14] limestone at the end of it this is all his theory not mine um

[01:06:18] the end of it there was this Limestone which is permeable right so the

[01:06:22] Limestone which is porous these gases come through and

[01:06:25] creates this hydrogen that's inside of this chamber

[01:06:29] then there are these shafts inside the king's chamber that

[01:06:33] are they're they're getting uh energy from space you know

[01:06:36] gamma rays and all the [ __ ] from space and that it's going through

[01:06:40] these Chambers which are very specifically designed to Target

[01:06:44] this these gases and put them into this chamber where they would interact

[01:06:47] with this energy and he believes it's enough to create electricity man my

[01:06:51] it's a crazy Theory but look I'm always I'm always too uh too

[01:06:55] fast to buk all these things but um like my just coming back

[01:06:58] to our earlier conversation it it sound it

[01:07:02] it must have been a crazy power print to have a containment structure much bigger than a nuclear

[01:07:05] reactor yeah well it's ridiculous but it's also a different kind of Technology

[01:07:10] right if nuclear technology was completely not on the table they didn't understand atoms

[01:07:13] at all but they did understand that there's rays that

[01:07:17] come from space and that you could somehow harness the energy

[01:07:21] of these things with specific gases and through some method

[01:07:25] con convert that into some form of electricity but

[01:07:28] it if it takes so much power to put all

[01:07:32] these rocks on the pyramid you have to always look at how efficient the

[01:07:35] power plant is so um so it can't just be some it has to be

[01:07:39] like the the craziest reaction ever to justify

[01:07:43] such a big containment structure because even nuclear power plants don't work economically

[01:07:47] barely work it well they didn't do a lot of them you know they only

[01:07:51] did this one in Giza and then there was other pyramids that he

[01:07:54] thinks had different functions that were smaller but the

[01:07:58] whole purpose of it is or the whole point of it is we

[01:08:02] we don't know what the [ __ ] it is we don't know why they did it

[01:08:05] we have uh a group of new archaeologists that are

[01:08:09] looking at it from a completely different Theory they're not looking at it like it's a tomb the

[01:08:13] established archaeologists have insisted that this is a tomb for the Pharaoh the

[01:08:16] newer archaeologists established archaeologists are looking at it and considering

[01:08:20] whether or not there were some other uses for this thing and one of them is the concept

[01:08:24] of the par I'm always I don't

[01:08:27] know if this is an alternate history Theory but I

[01:08:31] I'm always into the James Frasier golden

[01:08:35] B Renee Gerard violence

[01:08:39] sacred history where um you know you have always this question

[01:08:43] about um the origins of monarchy and

[01:08:47] kingship and um the the sort

[01:08:51] of Gerard Frasier intuition is

[01:08:55] um that uh it's something like

[01:08:59] um it is something like if um

[01:09:03] if every King is a kind of living God

[01:09:07] then uh we have to also believe the opposite that maybe every God

[01:09:12] is a dead or murdered King and that uh

[01:09:15] that somehow societies were organized around scapegoats

[01:09:19] the scapegoats were um you know there was sort of a crisis

[01:09:23] in the archaic Community it got blamed on a scapegoat

[01:09:27] the scapegoat was attributed all these powers

[01:09:31] and then at some point the scapegoat before he gets

[01:09:35] executed figures out a way to postpone his execution and turn the power

[01:09:38] into something real and so there's sort of this this very

[01:09:43] um weird adjacency between mon the Monarch and the

[01:09:46] scapegoat and uh and then you know I don't know the sort

[01:09:50] of Riff on the would be that the first pyramid did not need

[01:09:54] to be invented it was just the stones that were thrown on a victim

[01:09:57] and then it somehow and that that's the original

[01:10:02] the original stones that were thrown on a victim a community Stones a victim

[01:10:05] to death tribe runs after a victim you Stone him to death

[01:10:09] you throw stones on the victim that's how you create the first Tomb

[01:10:13] H and then um and then as it gets more complicated you create a

[01:10:17] tomb that's two million stones

[01:10:20] and and you get a you get a pharaoh you get a pharaoh who

[01:10:24] figures out a way to postpone his own execution or something like

[01:10:28] this I I think there's um I'm going to blank on

[01:10:31] the name of this ritual but I believe in old in in the old Egyptian

[01:10:35] kingdoms which were sort of around the time of the Great Pyramids

[01:10:39] or even before um there it was something

[01:10:42] like um in the 30th

[01:10:46] year of the reign of the Pharaoh the Pharaoh gets

[01:10:50] transformed into a living God and um

[01:10:54] and then um this perhaps dates to a time

[01:10:58] where um in the 30th year of the pharaoh's Reign the

[01:11:01] Pharaoh would get ritually sacrificed or or killed and you have

[01:11:05] you know you have all these societies where the Kings lived

[01:11:09] were allowed to rule for an a lot of time where you you know you you become king

[01:11:13] and you you draw the number of Pebbles out of a

[01:11:16] base and that corresponds to how many years was this Jamie

[01:11:20] the said Festival HEB said Festival of tale was an

[01:11:23] ancient Egyptian ceremony that celebrated the continued rule of pharaoh

[01:11:27] the name was taken from the name of the Egyptian wolf God one of whom's name

[01:11:31] was whip this is what I'm talking about or said the

[01:11:34] less formal Feast name the Feast of the tale is to yeah next paragraph

[01:11:38] is the one to start okay no that that one right there the the ancient Festival

[01:11:42] might perhaps have been instituted to replace a ritual of

[01:11:46] murdering a pharaoh who was unable to continue to rule effectively because

[01:11:49] of age or condition interesting interesting so

[01:11:53] you can't kill him now and then eventually said festivals were Jubilee

[01:11:57] several had thrown for 30 years

[01:12:00] and then every 3 to four years after that so when it becomes Unthinkable to

[01:12:04] kill the Pharaoh the Pharaoh gets turned into a living God before

[01:12:08] that the Pharaoh gets murdered and then gets worshiped

[01:12:12] as a dead Pharaoh or distant God that's

[01:12:15] interesting but it still doesn't solve the engineering puzzle the engineering

[01:12:19] puzzle is the biggest one like how did they do that well the one the one I'm focusing

[01:12:23] on is the motivational puzzle even if you have all the motivation in

[01:12:26] the world if you want to build a structure that's insane to build today

[01:12:30] and you're doing it 4,500 years ago we're dealing with a massive puzzle

[01:12:35] I I think I think I think the motivational part's the harder one to solve if

[01:12:38] if if you can figure out the motivation you'll you'll you'll

[01:12:42] figure out a way to organize the whole society and if you can figure out if you can get the whole society

[01:12:45] working on it you can probably do it but don't you think that his grasp on

[01:12:49] of power was in Peril in the first place which is

[01:12:53] why they decided to come up with this idea of turning them into a living

[01:12:56] God so to to have the amount of resources and power

[01:13:00] and then the engineering and then the understanding

[01:13:05] of whatever methods they use to shape and

[01:13:09] move these things well this is always the um this is always the

[01:13:12] anthropological debate between voler the enlightenment thinker

[01:13:16] of the 18th century and durkheim the 19th century

[01:13:20] Anthropologist and uh voler believes that

[01:13:24] um Rel religion originates as a conspiracy

[01:13:28] of the priests to maintain power and so politics comes

[01:13:31] first the politicians invent religion um

[01:13:35] and then durkheim says the causation the other way around

[01:13:39] that somehow religion came first and then politics

[01:13:42] somehow came out of it now of course you know once the politics comes out of

[01:13:46] it um you know the the priests the religious authorities

[01:13:50] have political power they figure out ways to manipulate it things like this

[01:13:53] but uh but I I find you know I find the

[01:13:57] durkheim story far more plausible than the volar

[01:14:01] one I think the religious categories are are primary

[01:14:04] and the the political categories are are are secondary so you

[01:14:08] think the religious the religion came first but what about

[01:14:12] if we emanated from tribal societies tribal societies have always had leaders

[01:14:16] when you have leaders you're going to have dissent you're going to have challenges you're going to have politic

[01:14:20] and you have people negotiating to try to maintain power keep power

[01:14:23] keep everything organized that's the origin of politics correct

[01:14:28] uh you know I I I think that's a that's a whitewashed

[01:14:32] Enlightenment rationalist description of the origin of politics yeah what do you think

[01:14:36] the origin of politics is I think it's far more vile than that you know what you're what you're

[01:14:39] giving me well it's very vile the control and power and maintaining

[01:14:43] power involves murder and sabotage well that okay that's more like it

[01:14:47] but what you what what what what you gave me a minute ago

[01:14:51] sounds more like a social contract theory in which people sit

[01:14:55] down negotiate and have you know a nice legal chitchat

[01:14:58] to drop the social contract that is a complete fiction

[01:15:02] yeah I don't think that I think that there was probably various

[01:15:06] levels of Civility that were achieved when Agriculture and

[01:15:09] when establishments were

[01:15:13] constructed that were near resources where they didn't have to worry as much

[01:15:17] about food and water and things along those lines things probably got a little

[01:15:20] bit more civil but I think that the origins of it are like the origins

[01:15:24] of all human conflict it's filled with murder well I think at the beginning

[01:15:28] was Madness and murder yeah Madness and murder and and I don't

[01:15:32] know I don't I don't know if it got I don't know if it

[01:15:36] got that much more rational I don't know if it's that much more rational

[01:15:40] today well so in some ways it's not right

[01:15:44] this again this again back to the you know the the progressive conception

[01:15:48] are we you know are we really have we really progressed

[01:15:52] how much have we really progressed from from that but but uh but yeah I my

[01:15:56] my uh my version would be that it was you know it

[01:16:00] was much more um um it was organized

[01:16:04] around you know acts of uh Mass violence

[01:16:08] like maybe maybe you externalize it onto you know a Mastadon or

[01:16:11] hunting some big animal or something like this but uh but

[01:16:15] the real problem of violence you know it wasn't external it was

[01:16:19] mostly internal it was it was violence with people

[01:16:22] who were near you proximate to you um it wasn't even

[01:16:26] natural CL cataclysms or other tribes it was it

[01:16:29] was uh it was sort of um much more uh

[01:16:33] the internal stuff and um it's very different I think the the

[01:16:37] human situation is somehow very very different from something

[01:16:41] like I don't know an ape primate hierarchy where you know in

[01:16:44] an ape context you have an alpha male um

[01:16:48] you know he's the strongest and there's some sort of natural dominance and you

[01:16:52] don't need to have a fight to the death typically because you

[01:16:55] know who's the strongest and you don't need to um push it all the

[01:16:59] way in a human context it's always possible

[01:17:03] for two or three guys to gang up on the alpha male so

[01:17:06] uh so it's uh it's somehow the culture is more

[01:17:10] important you know and if they can talk to each other and you

[01:17:13] get language and then they can coordinate and they can gang up on

[01:17:17] on the leader and then you have to stop them from gting up on the leader and how how do you do

[01:17:21] that and so the there's some sort of radical

[01:17:25] difference between a you know a human and a let's say an

[01:17:28] um a prehuman world have you seen chimp

[01:17:32] Empire no chimp Empire is a fascinating documentary

[01:17:36] series on Netflix where these scientists had been embedded with

[01:17:39] this tribe of chimpanzees for decades and so

[01:17:43] because they were embedded they had very specific rules you has to maintain

[01:17:47] at least 20 yards from you and any of the chimps no food

[01:17:50] you can never have food and don't look them in the eyes and as long as you do that

[01:17:54] they don't feel you're a threat and they think of you as a natural part of their environment

[01:17:58] almost like you don't exist they and they behave completely naturally

[01:18:02] well it shows in that that sometimes it's not the largest

[01:18:06] strongest one and that some chimps form bonds with

[01:18:09] other chimps and they form coalitions and they do have some sort

[01:18:13] of politicking and they do help each other they groom

[01:18:17] each other they do specific things for each other and then one of the things that happens

[01:18:20] also they get invaded by other chimps and that chimps

[01:18:24] leave and they go on patrol and other chimps gang up on them and kill them and they try to

[01:18:28] fight and battle over resources so it's not nearly

[01:18:32] as cut and dry as the strongest chimp prevails because one of the

[01:18:35] chimps that was dominant was an older chimp and he was smaller than some of

[01:18:39] the other chimps but he had formed a coalition with all these other chimps

[01:18:43] and they all respected him and they all knew that they would be treated fairly

[01:18:47] and being treated fairly is a very important thing with chimpanzees

[01:18:50] they get very jealous if they think that things are not fair which is why

[01:18:54] that guy was attacked and you know that guy who had a um pet chimpanzee

[01:18:58] he brought it a birthday cake the other chimps weren't getting a piece of the

[01:19:02] cake and they someone had [ __ ] up and left a door open they got out and

[01:19:05] mauled this guy because he didn't give them some of the cake yeah so I

[01:19:09] I find all of that quite plausible but I think

[01:19:13] both of us can be correct so there's some the the

[01:19:17] the true story of harmonization of how we became humans there's

[01:19:20] a way to tell it where it's continuous with our animal past and

[01:19:24] where it's just you know there's things like this with the chimpanzees

[01:19:28] or the baboons or you know um other primates

[01:19:31] and then um there is a part of the story that I think is also

[01:19:35] more discontinuous um and um you know my

[01:19:39] my judgment is we probably you know in a in a darwinian context

[01:19:43] we always stress the continuity um you know I'm I'm

[01:19:46] always a little bit the contrarian and so um you I Believe In Darwin's theory

[01:19:50] but uh I think uh I think uh we should also be skeptical

[01:19:54] of ways it's too dogmatic and uh and Darwin's

[01:19:58] theories make us gloss over the discontinuities and

[01:20:01] I think you know the one one type of happen

[01:20:05] overnight but one type of Fairly dramatic discontinuity

[01:20:09] is that um you know is that humans have something like language

[01:20:12] and even though you know chimpanzees probably I don't know they have an IQ of 80 or they're pretty they're

[01:20:16] pretty smart but but when you don't have a

[01:20:20] rich symbolic system um that that leads

[01:20:23] to sort of a very very different kind of structure and and there's something about

[01:20:27] uh um uh language and

[01:20:30] the kind of coordination that allows and the ways that it

[01:20:34] forces you to it enables you to coordinate on violence and then

[01:20:38] it encourages you to channel violence in certain sacred religious

[01:20:42] directions um uh I think uh creates a

[01:20:46] you know something radically different about human society we're you know we differ

[01:20:49] you know we we tell humans tell each other stories

[01:20:53] um a lot of the stories are not true true they're myths but uh

[01:20:57] that's that is a that's I think that's an some some sort of a very

[01:21:00] important difference from uh from even our closest uh

[01:21:04] uh uh primate uh primate relatives

[01:21:08] um but you know this is again this is sort of like another way of

[01:21:12] getting at what's uh so crazy about uh chat GPT

[01:21:16] and passing the touring test because if we had sat here two years

[01:21:20] ago and you asked me you know what what is the distinctive feature

[01:21:23] of a human being what makes someone a human and you know

[01:21:27] how and in a way that differs from everybody else

[01:21:31] um you know it's not perfect but my go-to answer would been language

[01:21:35] you're you know you're threeyear old you're an 80y old you

[01:21:38] know just about all humans can speak languages just about

[01:21:42] all non-humans cannot speak languages it's this it's

[01:21:46] this binary thing and then that's that's sort of a way of telling us again

[01:21:50] why why passing the touring test was way more important

[01:21:54] than super intelligence or anything else yeah I could see

[01:21:58] that I don't want go back to that tangent no it's a good tangent

[01:22:01] great keep tangent and off have fun it's great um do you

[01:22:05] think what what do you think the factor was there's a lot of debate about this

[01:22:09] like the factor was that separated us from these animals and why

[01:22:12] we became what we became because we're so vastly different than any other

[01:22:16] primate like so what do you think took place like the doubling of

[01:22:19] the human brain size over a period of 2 million years is one of the greatest

[01:22:23] mysteries in the entire fossil record we don't know what the [ __ ] happened there's a lot of

[01:22:27] theories the throwing arm cooking meat there's a lot of theories

[01:22:30] but we we really have no idea well again if I if I

[01:22:35] let me do sort of linguistic riff I think um

[01:22:39] Aristotelian darwinian biology Aristotle you always

[01:22:43] differ things by put them in categories and and uh

[01:22:47] um man I think the line Aristotle has is something man

[01:22:51] differs from the other animals in his greater aptitud ude

[01:22:54] for imitation and um

[01:22:58] and and I would say uh it

[01:23:02] that um we are these giant imitating machines and of course the darwinian

[01:23:06] Riff on this is you know to imitate is to ape

[01:23:10] and um and so we differ from the AP we're more aplike

[01:23:14] than the Apes we are far better at aping each other

[01:23:17] than the apes are and um and that uh

[01:23:21] to you know a first cut I would say our brains are giant imitation

[01:23:25] machines that's how you learn language as a kid you imitate your parents

[01:23:28] uh and that's how culture gets transmitted but then

[01:23:32] um there are a lot of dimensions of imitation that uh

[01:23:36] that are also very dangerous because um it's not imitation

[01:23:39] doesn't just happen on this symbolic linguistic level

[01:23:43] it's also you imitate things you want you want a banana

[01:23:47] I want a banana you want a blue ball I can have a red ball I

[01:23:51] want a blue ball because you have a blue ball and um

[01:23:55] and and so there's something about imitation that um

[01:23:59] you know creates culture um you know that uh

[01:24:03] um that is incredibly important pedagogically

[01:24:08] learning you know it's how you master something how

[01:24:11] you know in all these different ways and then um and then a lot

[01:24:15] of it has this uh has this incredibly conflictual Dimension

[01:24:18] as well and uh and then there's yes so I think

[01:24:22] I think that was sort of core to

[01:24:25] the things that are both great and troubled

[01:24:29] about humanity and and uh and that was sort of

[01:24:33] that was in some ways the problem that that needed to be solved so you think

[01:24:37] that the motivation of imitation is the

[01:24:41] the essential first steps that led us to become

[01:24:45] human um there's some story like and again

[01:24:49] this is a one-dimensional one explanation fits all but

[01:24:53] yeah the EXP sort of the explanation I would I would go with

[01:24:56] is that it was it was something like um

[01:25:00] you know our brains got bigger and so we were more powerful imitation

[01:25:04] machines and there were things about that that were you know

[01:25:08] that were um yeah that made us

[01:25:12] a lot more powerful and a lot we could learn things and

[01:25:15] we could remember things and there was cultural transmission that happened but

[01:25:19] then um it also we could build better weapons

[01:25:23] and we became more violent and um it it

[01:25:26] also had a very very destructive element and then

[01:25:30] somehow the imitation you know had to be had to be channeled in

[01:25:34] in these sort of ritualized religious you know

[01:25:38] kinds of ways and that's that's that's why

[01:25:42] um I I think all these things sort of somehow came to up together

[01:25:46] in parallel what about the physical adaptation like what would be the motivation

[01:25:50] of the animal to change form and to have its brain grow

[01:25:54] so large and to lose all its hair and to become

[01:25:58] soft and fleshy like we are as opposed to like rough

[01:26:01] and durable like almost every other primate

[01:26:05] is well you can always man you can always tell these

[01:26:09] retrospective Just So Stories and how this all

[01:26:13] all worked out but it it would seem

[01:26:17] the the naive retrospective story would be that uh um

[01:26:21] you know there are a lot of ways that humans are

[01:26:25] I don't know less strong than the other apes or

[01:26:29] you know there all all these ways where we're in some sense

[01:26:32] weaker physically at least physically but um but maybe it was

[01:26:36] just this basic trade-off you you know yeah more more of your energy

[01:26:39] went into your mind and into your brain and um

[01:26:44] and then you know um you you were

[01:26:47] your fist wasn't as strong but you could build a better

[01:26:52] Axe and that made you stronger than an ape

[01:26:55] and that's that's yeah where where you know a brain

[01:26:59] with you know less I don't know less energy was spent on

[01:27:03] growing a hair to keep warm in the winter and and then you used

[01:27:07] your brain to build an Axe and skin a bear and get get some fur

[01:27:11] for the winter some something like that yeah I guess

[01:27:15] it's just but it's just such a leap it's such a leap and different

[01:27:19] than any other animal like and like what was the primary

[01:27:22] motivating factor like what the thing you know McKenna believes it was

[01:27:26] psilocybin you know I'm sure you probably ever heard that theory McKenna's

[01:27:30] Stone ape Theory which is a fasina any one but there's a lot of

[01:27:34] different theories about what took place but

[01:27:37] we're just well the one yeah the one I would go on was

[01:27:41] that there was this dimension of increased

[01:27:45] imitation there was some kind of cultural linguistic Dimension

[01:27:49] that was incredibly um important um

[01:27:53] it probably was also you know it was probably also uh

[01:27:57] somehow linked to uh to uh

[01:28:01] you know dealing with um all the violence

[01:28:05] that came with it all the conflicts that that that came with it

[01:28:09] um you know I would be I'd be more open to the stoned

[01:28:13] ape theory if people um I had this conversation

[01:28:16] with the other guy Mur rescu the immortality key Guy

[01:28:20] and um I always feel they whitewash it too much how

[01:28:24] so you know it's like if I mean if if you had these crazy

[01:28:28] Dian rituals in which people

[01:28:31] you know if you know there's probably lots of crazy sex there was

[01:28:35] probably lots of crazy violence that was was tied to

[01:28:39] it and and so maybe like maybe you'd be out of your mind to

[01:28:42] be hunting a woolly mammoth and like maybe maybe you can't be

[01:28:46] completely you know but they weren't hunting Willie Mammoth

[01:28:50] during the ucini Mysteries no but you

[01:28:53] were I don't know you went to went to war to fight the neighboring tribe it's probably more dangerous

[01:28:57] than hunting right but they also did absolutely have these rituals

[01:29:00] and they have absolutely found Trace elements of I don't I don't question

[01:29:04] that okay I don't question that at all I I I just I I I just

[01:29:08] I just think uh they they probably part of it was

[01:29:12] ALS also uh was a way to channel violence

[01:29:16] was probably you know whenever I don't know was there some

[01:29:20] some degree to which um whenever you went to war

[01:29:24] you were on drugs you were well we know about the Vikings

[01:29:27] the Vikings most certainly took mushrooms before they went into battle

[01:29:32] and um and you know maybe it

[01:29:35] makes you less less coordinated

[01:29:39] or something but but if you're just if you're less scared that's probably

[01:29:43] it doesn't make you less coordinated if you're just a little bit less scared that's probably super important

[01:29:47] it increases visual Acuity there's a lot of benefits that would happen

[01:29:50] physically especially if you got the dose right

[01:29:54] you know um it increases visual Acuity edge detections

[01:29:58] better uh makes people more sensitive probably more aware probably

[01:30:02] a better Hunter and uh but I think I I

[01:30:05] I'm I'm I'm sympathetic to all all these

[01:30:09] um mushrooms um psychedelic drug

[01:30:13] historical usage theories I suspect was very widespread

[01:30:17] um I just think you know a lot of it was in in these

[01:30:21] contexts that uh that were pretty trans aggressive yeah I think

[01:30:25] um they're not mutually exclusive I think just giving the

[01:30:29] the way the world was back then for sure violence was everywhere

[01:30:32] violence was a part of daily life violence was a part of how Society

[01:30:36] was kept together violence was entertainment in Rome right

[01:30:40] for sure violence was uh was everything was a big part of

[01:30:44] it and I think release and and the anxiety of that

[01:30:47] violence also LED people to want to be intoxicated and do

[01:30:51] different things that uh separated them from a normal State of

[01:30:55] Consciousness um but I do think it's also probably where democracy

[01:30:59] came from I I think having those ilian mystery

[01:31:02] rituals where they would get together and do psychedelics and under this very

[01:31:06] controlled set and setting I think that's the birthplace of

[01:31:10] a lot of very interesting and innovative ideas I think

[01:31:13] a lot of interesting and innovative ideas currently

[01:31:17] are are being at least uh dreamt

[01:31:21] up thought of they have their roots in some sort of altered

[01:31:25] conscious

[01:31:29] experience well

[01:31:34] um it's man I I don't know I I think this

[01:31:37] stuff is very powerful I think it is

[01:31:41] it is

[01:31:45] I definitely think it shouldn't be outlawed

[01:31:49] you know pretty hardcore libertarian on all the drug legalization

[01:31:55] stuff uh and then

[01:31:58] I I do I do Wonder

[01:32:03] um I do Wonder exactly how how

[01:32:07] how how how these things work

[01:32:12] it probably you know probably the classical

[01:32:15] World version of it um

[01:32:19] was that it was something that you did in a fairly controlled

[01:32:25] setting you didn't do it every day um

[01:32:29] and it was it was sort of it was some it was some

[01:32:33] way uh I imagine to get you know a very different perspective

[01:32:37] on your 9 to-5 job or whatever you want to call it

[01:32:41] but uh you didn't necessarily want to you know

[01:32:45] want to really DeCamp to the other world altogether

[01:32:49] oh for sure it's too dangerous to do um I don't

[01:32:52] think anybody thinks they did did I think that was part of the whole thing

[01:32:57] where do where do you think where do you think that line is

[01:33:00] like you know should PE should everyone do one iasa

[01:33:04] trip or if you do if you do an

[01:33:08] iasa trip a year is that I don't think everyone

[01:33:11] has to do anything and I think everyone has their own requirements and I

[01:33:15] think um I think as you do that everything

[01:33:19] like this especially psychedelics one of the more disappointing things recently

[01:33:22] was that the FDA had denied um they they did these MDMA

[01:33:26] trials for you know about all this yep yeah very very disappointing

[01:33:30] um that they wanted to make MDMA therapy available

[01:33:34] to Veterans and people with severe PTSD and it has

[01:33:37] extreme benefits clinical benefits known documented

[01:33:41] benefits and for whatever reason the FDA decided that they have to go through a

[01:33:45] whole new series of Trials to tr try to get this

[01:33:48] stuff legalized which is very disappointing and yeah I I

[01:33:52] I I was I was very bullish on

[01:33:56] the stuff happening um and the way I thought

[01:33:59] about it four or five years ago was um

[01:34:03] that um it was a hack to doing a double blind study

[01:34:07] and because the FDA always has this concept that you need to do

[01:34:11] a double blind study you give one one you know onethird of the

[01:34:14] people you give a sugar pill and two-thirds you give the real drug and you have

[01:34:18] to and no one knows whether they have the sugar pill or the real drug and

[01:34:22] then um and then you see how it works works and science requires a

[01:34:25] double blind study and then my my anti-

[01:34:29] double blind study theory is if if it really works you don't need a

[01:34:33] double blind study it should just work and there's something

[01:34:37] sociopathic about doing double blind studies because one third of the people who

[01:34:40] have this bad disease are getting a sugar pill and we we shouldn't even be

[01:34:44] like maybe it's um immoral to do double blind studies studies

[01:34:48] on unique and novel things make sense um

[01:34:52] this is not unique nor novel it's been around a long well unique yes

[01:34:55] but well my my claim is if it's if it's a

[01:34:59] um uh if it actually works you shouldn't need to do a double blind

[01:35:03] study at all but um and then my Hope was

[01:35:06] that um MDMA psychedelics all these things

[01:35:10] they were a hack on the double blind study because um you

[01:35:14] knew whether you got the real thing or the sugar pill and so this would be a way

[01:35:18] to um to hack through this ridiculous double blind Criterion

[01:35:22] and just get the study done and then what I what I

[01:35:25] think um part part of it it's probably just

[01:35:29] an anti-drug ideology by the FDA but um but

[01:35:32] the other part that happened on the sort of science scientific

[01:35:36] establishment level is they think you need a double blind study

[01:35:40] Joe we know you're hacking this double blind study because people will know

[01:35:44] whether they got the sugar pill or not and that's why we're going to

[01:35:47] arbitrarily change the goal posts and set them at

[01:35:51] way way harder because we know there's no way you can do a double blind study

[01:35:55] and if it's not a double blind study it's no good because that's what our ideology of

[01:35:59] science tells us and um and that's sort of

[01:36:03] that's sort of what I think was part of part of

[01:36:07] what went um sort of politically Haywire with this stuff well

[01:36:10] I also think that it's Pandora's Box I think that's a

[01:36:14] real issue and that if uh they do find extreme benefit

[01:36:18] in using MDMA therapy particularly for veterans

[01:36:22] if they start doing and it starts becoming very effective and it becomes well known and

[01:36:26] widespread then it will open up the door to all these other psychedelic

[01:36:29] compounds and I think that's a real threat to the powers that

[01:36:33] be it's a real threat to the establishment if you have people thinking

[01:36:37] in a completely alternative way and mean we saw what happened during the 1960s

[01:36:41] and that's one of the reasons why they threw water on everything and had it

[01:36:45] become schedule one and locked the country down in terms of

[01:36:48] the the access to psychedelics all that stuff happened out of

[01:36:53] a reaction to the way society and culture was changing

[01:36:56] in the 1960s if that happened today it

[01:37:00] would throw a giant monkey wrench

[01:37:03] in our political system in our cultural system the way we govern

[01:37:07] the way we just the way allocation of resources all

[01:37:11] that would change if I if I if I just to

[01:37:14] articulate the alternate version on this um

[01:37:19] there's always a you know there's

[01:37:23] there's a part um let me think how to how to get this

[01:37:28] um you know there's there's one

[01:37:32] there's a question whether um this

[01:37:36] the shift to interiority um is it

[01:37:40] a compliment or a substitute like what I said about

[01:37:43] talk and action is it a compliment or a substitute to

[01:37:47] changing the outside world so we focus on changing ourselves is

[01:37:50] this the first step to changing the world or is

[01:37:54] it um is it sort of a hypnotic way in which our

[01:37:58] attention is being redirected to from outer space to Inner

[01:38:01] Space so I don't know the one liner I had years ago was um you know we

[01:38:05] landed on the moon in July of 1969

[01:38:08] and three weeks later Woodstock started and that's when the hippies took over the country

[01:38:13] and um and you know and um we stopped going to outer

[01:38:17] space because we started going to Inner Space and that's and so there's sort of a question

[01:38:21] um you know how much the you know um it

[01:38:25] it it worked as a um as an activator

[01:38:29] or as a or as a a

[01:38:32] deactivator in a way um and uh you know there are all these different

[01:38:36] modalities of interiority there's psychological therapy

[01:38:40] there's meditation there's yoga there's um you know

[01:38:44] there was a sexual Revolution there were gradually you have incels

[01:38:48] living in their parents basement playing video games so they all you know there's

[01:38:51] um the naval gazing that is identity politics

[01:38:55] um there's a range of psychedelic things and um

[01:38:59] and I think all of these things

[01:39:02] um I I I wonder whether the interiority

[01:39:07] ended up acting as a as a substitute because you know the alternate history in

[01:39:10] the 1960s is that um you know the hippies

[01:39:15] were actually they were anti-political and uh

[01:39:18] it was it was sort of that the the the drugs happened

[01:39:23] at the end of the city at the end of the 60s and that's when people depoliticized

[01:39:27] you it was like I don't know the beatle s you're carrying around pictures of shairon ma you're not going to

[01:39:31] make with anyone anyhow it's like that's after they did LSD

[01:39:34] it was just the sort of insane politics no longer

[01:39:38] matters and so you have the Civil Rights the Vietnam War and then

[01:39:42] were the drugs the thing that motivated it or was that

[01:39:45] was that the thing where it actually um those those things started to

[01:39:49] started to deescalate I think they were happening at the same time and I think

[01:39:53] the Vietnam war coinciding with the psychedelic drug movement

[01:39:57] in the 1960s it was one of the reasons why it was so dangerous

[01:40:00] to The Establishment CU these people were far less likely to

[01:40:04] buy into this idea that they needed to fly to Vietnam and go kill people they didn't

[01:40:07] know and they were far less likely to support any war

[01:40:12] and I think there was this sort of bizarre movement

[01:40:15] that we had never seen before this flower children move that we

[01:40:19] know that they plotted against I mean if you read chaos uh by Tom O'Neal

[01:40:23] familiar with fantastic book that shows you what they were trying to do

[01:40:27] to demonize these these hippies well was or or

[01:40:31] or the the part of it that I thought was interesting was the MK Ultra yeah

[01:40:34] which part of it where um you know we uh there

[01:40:38] was a a predecessor version where uh

[01:40:42] we thought of um you know there was a you could think of it as we had

[01:40:45] an arms race with f the fascists and the

[01:40:49] Communists and they were very good at brainwashing people the gobl

[01:40:52] propaganda North Koreans brainwashing our soldiers in the Korean

[01:40:56] War um our PS and uh

[01:41:00] we needed to have an arms race to program and

[01:41:03] reprogram and deprogram people and um LSD

[01:41:07] was uh was was sort of the MK ultra shortcut so

[01:41:11] I think I think there was and then I

[01:41:15] yeah my so hard to reconstruct it

[01:41:18] but uh my my suspicion is that the MK Ultra thing was

[01:41:22] was a lot bigger than than we realize

[01:41:25] and that uh you know it was it was the LSD movement both

[01:41:29] in the Harvard form and the Stanford form you know it started

[01:41:33] it started as an MK Ultra project Timothy liry at Harvard um

[01:41:36] Ken keesy at Stanford you know I knew uh Tom Wolf the

[01:41:41] um American novelist I still think his greatest novel

[01:41:45] was uh um the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test which is sort of this history

[01:41:48] of the LSD counterculture movement starts at Stanford moves

[01:41:52] the hate Ashbury and San Francisco and uh but it starts with Ken key

[01:41:56] a grad student at Stanford like I Circa

[01:41:59] 1958 and um you get an extra $75

[01:42:03] a day if you go to the Meno Park veterans hospital

[01:42:07] and um they give you some random drug and um

[01:42:12] yeah he got extra $75 a grad student in English um doing

[01:42:16] LSD and um Tom Wolf writes this

[01:42:20] you know iconic uh fictionalized novel very realistic

[01:42:25] 1968 about this and um

[01:42:28] wolf could not have imagined that the whole thing started as some

[01:42:33] CIA mind control project right the menal park veterans

[01:42:36] hospital that was deep State adjacent sure well ha

[01:42:40] ashbery free clinic run by the CIA sure that's even crazier

[01:42:43] the whole thing's crazy Jolly Jolly West guy y yeah

[01:42:47] the the whole thing's crazy which leads me to

[01:42:51] what do you think they're doing today if they were doing

[01:42:55] that then I do not believe that they abandoned this idea

[01:42:58] of programming people I do not believe that I don't think they

[01:43:02] would because I know it's effective look people join Cults every day

[01:43:06] we're well aware that people can be ideologically captured

[01:43:10] we're well aware we're well aware people will buy into

[01:43:13] crazy ideas as long as it's supported by whatever

[01:43:17] Community they associate with that's a just a natural

[01:43:21] aspect of being a human being maybe it's part of what you were saying this

[01:43:24] imitation thing that we have it leads us to do this if they have

[01:43:28] that knowledge and that understanding that for sure they're probably doing

[01:43:32] things similar today which is one of the things that I think

[01:43:36] about a lot when I think about this guy that tried to shoot Trump

[01:43:39] I I want to know what happened and I

[01:43:43] don't think we're getting a very detailed explanation at all

[01:43:47] as to how this person achieved these

[01:43:51] the get how he they got on the roof how they got to that position how they trained

[01:43:55] what who were they in contact with who was teaching them

[01:43:58] why did they why did they do it what was going on we we are

[01:44:02] in the dark and I wonder like you

[01:44:06] know that was always The Manchurian Candidate idea right this idea that we trained

[01:44:09] assassins and was the RFK uh dad um

[01:44:13] assassination 196 s where um he again

[01:44:17] maybe shouldn't believe him but he claimed that uh he didn't even know what he was

[01:44:20] doing it was on some hypnotic trance or whatever and it was like

[01:44:24] it was like the assassin in The Manchurian Candidate yeah yeah I mean

[01:44:28] that is possible I don't know if he's telling the truth he could have just had

[01:44:32] a psychotic break who knows obviously also convenient

[01:44:35] yeah very convenient but it's a possibility that she could

[01:44:39] be should be considered I mean I this Crooks kid that did

[01:44:43] this that shot at the president what how

[01:44:46] what happened I want to know what happened man I

[01:44:50] I don't I I probably

[01:44:54] Veer in the direction that there

[01:45:00] were you know on the on the sort of conspiracy theory of

[01:45:04] History I Veer in the direction that there was a

[01:45:07] lot of crazy stuff like this that was going on in the

[01:45:11] US first half of the 20th century

[01:45:14] overdrive 1940s you I mean you had the

[01:45:18] Manhattan Project there's this giant secret project uh

[01:45:22] 1950 s 1960s and then

[01:45:26] um and then somehow the last 50

[01:45:29] years I think the I'm not sure disturbing

[01:45:34] uh P but the perspective I have is these institutions

[01:45:37] are less functional I I don't think um

[01:45:42] I don't think the CIA is doing anything quite like MK Ultra

[01:45:46] anymore um why do you think that

[01:45:58] I think you had the church commission hearings in the late 70s

[01:46:02] and uh and somehow things things

[01:46:05] got things got exposed and um

[01:46:09] and then um when when things when a bureaucracy

[01:46:13] is forced to be formalized um it probably becomes

[01:46:17] a lot less functional you know um there was a

[01:46:20] like the 2000s version there was I think there was a lot of crazy

[01:46:24] stuff that we did in Black sites torturing

[01:46:28] people um that the CIA ran you know

[01:46:32] in the war on terror uh water boarding there's all sorts of batshit

[01:46:36] crazy stuff that happened but then um you know once John Yu

[01:46:40] in the bush 43 Administration writes the torture memos and sort of

[01:46:43] formalizes this is how many times you can water dunk someone without it being torture

[01:46:47] etc etc once you formalize it people somehow know

[01:46:51] that it's on its way out because you know

[01:46:55] um it doesn't quite work anymore so by I don't know by

[01:47:00] 2007 um at Guantanamo I think the inmates were

[01:47:03] running the Asylum the inmates and the defense lawyers were running it

[01:47:07] you were way safer as a Muslim terrorist in Guantanamo

[01:47:11] than as a let's say suspected cop killer in Manhattan there was still an informal

[01:47:15] process in Manhattan you were suspected cop killer they'd figure out some way

[01:47:20] to um to deal with you out inside the judicial

[01:47:24] the formal judicial process um and um but

[01:47:27] I think something there was a sort of formalization that happened there was the post

[01:47:31] uh J Edgar Hoover FBI where Hoover was

[01:47:35] I don't know a law unto himself it was completely

[01:47:39] out of control CIA even more so

[01:47:42] and then um you know once it all gets exposed and uh

[01:47:46] um it it probably is a lot harder to do the NSA

[01:47:50] you know NSA probably held up longer as a deep State entity

[01:47:55] where it at least had the virtue people you know I think the 1980s

[01:47:59] it was still referred to as no such agency so it's still it

[01:48:02] was still far more obscure so the necessary condition

[01:48:06] is that if some part of the deep State's doing it you know we we we

[01:48:09] can barely know what's going on right with them

[01:48:13] and then I don't know you know the

[01:48:17] the 2000s 2010s history

[01:48:21] on the on on you know I think

[01:48:25] the Patriot Act empowered all these faisa courts

[01:48:29] and I think there was I think there probably

[01:48:33] um were ways the NSA fisa court process

[01:48:37] was was weaponized in a really really crazy way

[01:48:41] um and you know it culminated in in 2016 with

[01:48:44] all the um you know the crazy Russia conspiracy theories

[01:48:48] against Trump um but I I

[01:48:52] think even that I I'm not sure

[01:48:56] they can do anymore because it got exposed can't do that

[01:48:59] anymore but a small program that is

[01:49:03] top secret that is designed under the offices of

[01:49:07] protecting American lives extracting information

[01:49:11] from people I'm I'm I'm agreeing with you the the NSA

[01:49:14] fisa court process is is one where you had

[01:49:18] a pretty out ofc Control process from let's say Circa I don't know 2003

[01:49:22] to 2017 2018 so that's relatively

[01:49:26] recent history mhm

[01:49:31] um I don't know you know they're all the they're all the Jeffrey Epstein

[01:49:35] conspiracy theories uh which um

[01:49:39] I'm probably too fascinated by um

[01:49:42] because it felt like there was

[01:49:46] there was some crazy stuff going on that they were able to cover up and

[01:49:50] still are uh and then

[01:49:54] but then man doesn't it the fact that we're still

[01:49:57] talking about Jeffrey Epstein tell us um how hard it is to

[01:50:01] come up with anything else no because there's

[01:50:04] no answers for the Jeffrey Epstein thing there's been no consequences

[01:50:08] other than glain Maxwell going to jail and Jeffrey Epstein allegedly

[01:50:12] committing suicide which I don't think he did other than that

[01:50:16] what are the consequences they they they were able to pull off this thing this

[01:50:21] some some sort of operation what

[01:50:24] you know who knows who was behind it who knows what was the motivation but it clearly

[01:50:28] has something to do with compromising people which is an age-old strategy

[01:50:32] for getting people to do what you want them to do you have things on them you use

[01:50:36] those things as leverage and then next thing you know you've got people

[01:50:39] saying things that you want them to say do and and it motivate moves policy

[01:50:43] changes things get things done that they did

[01:50:47] that yes and no one and we know they did that and yet no one

[01:50:50] is asking for the tapes no one's asking asking for the The Client

[01:50:54] List we we're in the dark

[01:50:58] still and probably I don't know man I

[01:51:02] I I spend too much time thinking about all all the all the Epstein

[01:51:10] variants it pro probably probably

[01:51:14] the sex stuff is overdone and everything else is underdone it's like

[01:51:17] with it's like a limited hangout we get to talk about the crazy underage

[01:51:21] sex and um and you know not about

[01:51:25] all all the other questions it's like when Alex aosta testified

[01:51:29] for labor secretary under and he was he was the da who prosecuted

[01:51:33] Epstein in ' 0809 and um got him sort of the very

[01:51:36] light 13-month or whatever uh sentence

[01:51:40] and um was it South Florida da or

[01:51:44] whatever he was um and and uh

[01:51:48] aosta was asked you know

[01:51:51] um uh you know why did why did he

[01:51:55] get off so easily and and under Congressional testimony when he's

[01:51:58] up for labor secretary 2017 it was um

[01:52:02] he belonged to intelligence that's yeah and

[01:52:06] then and then you know um and so it's

[01:52:09] yeah it's it's it the question isn't about

[01:52:13] the sex with the underage women the question is is really

[01:52:17] about you know why was he why was he so protected and then

[01:52:20] you know I I went I I went down all these rabbit

[01:52:24] holes was he you know working for the Israelis or the Mad Or all all this sort

[01:52:27] of stuff and uh I've come to think that that's

[01:52:32] that was very secondary it was obviously it was just the US

[01:52:36] you know you know if you're working for Israel you don't get protected you know we

[01:52:40] had Jonathan Paul he went to jail for 25 years or whatever

[01:52:43] um and um but unrelated right understood

[01:52:47] but it's but it's uh but this is one particular operation

[01:52:50] But but so it's but it it was uh if if it was an

[01:52:54] intelligence operation the question we should be asking is what part of the US

[01:52:58] intelligence right system was was he working for was he working

[01:53:02] for you know but don't you think that's an effective strategy for controlling

[01:53:05] politicians getting them involved in sex scandals I mean that's always been one

[01:53:09] of the the worst things that can happen to a politician look at Monica Lewinsky

[01:53:13] a very simple one consensual inappropriate

[01:53:17] sexual relationship between a president and a staffer and it almost

[01:53:20] takes down the presidency it causes him to get

[01:53:25] impeached uh powerful motivators the shame

[01:53:29] of it all also the illegal activity the fact that it's I mean it's

[01:53:32] one of the most disgusting things that we think of with people having sex with

[01:53:36] underage people um I'm

[01:53:39] I'm I'm I'm sure that was part of it I suspect

[01:53:43] there are a lot of other questions that uh you know one one

[01:53:46] one should one should also most certainly but I would think that

[01:53:50] that is one of the best motivators that we have is

[01:53:54] having dirt on people like that especially something that could ruin your career

[01:53:57] especially people that are deeply embedded in this system

[01:54:02] of people knowing things about people and using those at their advant I mean

[01:54:05] that's an age-old strategy in politics that was Jay Edgar

[01:54:09] Hoover's entire modus Opera my my

[01:54:12] my my Riff on it was always that it was um it was

[01:54:16] it's it's a little bit different from the J Edgar Hoover thing

[01:54:20] and the question was always whether the people doing it knew

[01:54:24] they were getting compromised and so it's it's it's it it's

[01:54:27] the vibe is not that um

[01:54:31] um um you somehow got compromised it was more

[01:54:35] you were joining this uh this secret Club

[01:54:39] you got to be made you're a made man in the mafia and you get

[01:54:43] to do crazy things no no no no it's only if we have comprom

[01:54:46] mod on you do you get ahead right it's like you know it's like I

[01:54:50] don't know it's one of these uh um yeah

[01:54:53] closet of the vaan the claim is 80% of the Cardinals in the Catholic church

[01:54:57] are gay not sure if that's true but uh directionally

[01:55:01] it's probably correct and the the basic thesis is you don't get promoted

[01:55:05] to a cardinal if you're straight because um we

[01:55:08] need to have and so we need you need to be compromised and

[01:55:12] then you're under control um but you also get ahead

[01:55:16] completely makes sense completely makes sense in the way to do that with

[01:55:19] especially the all these politicians who are essentially

[01:55:23] like Bad actors a lot of them they're just people that want power

[01:55:26] and people that want control a lot of them and you know those kind

[01:55:30] of guys they want a party you know I mean that has been you've got two types

[01:55:34] of uh leaders that are presidents you got [ __ ] hounds and warmongers

[01:55:38] you know and you know some of sometimes you have both but generally you don't

[01:55:41] you guys like Clinton and JFK were anti-war and then

[01:55:45] you have guys like uh Bush who you don't think of at all as

[01:55:48] a [ __ ] Hound but most certainly you think of as a warmonger

[01:55:52] hm do you what what um what do you do you have a

[01:55:56] theory on what was Bill Gates's complicity with Epstein I

[01:55:59] think he likes [ __ ] I think I think he's a man

[01:56:03] I think he likes power he likes Monopoly I mean he's incredibly

[01:56:06] effective with Microsoft and for the longest time he was

[01:56:10] thought of as a villain right he was this antitrust villain he was

[01:56:14] this guy who was monopolizing this operating system and

[01:56:18] and and controlling just this incredible

[01:56:22] Empire and he had a real bad rap and then I think he

[01:56:26] wisely turned towards philanthropy and uh

[01:56:29] but do you do you do you think do you think that he needed

[01:56:33] Epstein I think it's very difficult a very famous

[01:56:37] very high-profile person to [ __ ] around I think it's very

[01:56:40] difficult I think you have to worry about people telling people you worry about

[01:56:44] it taking you down if you're having Affairs if you're running some

[01:56:48] pH philanthropy organization you're supposed to be thought of as this guy who's like this

[01:56:51] one wonderful person who's trying to really fix all the problems in the world but really he just

[01:56:55] flying around and and banging all these different chicks you have to figure

[01:56:59] out a way to pull that off and this

[01:57:02] is what uh Eric Weinstein and I we've had discussions about this and

[01:57:06] Eric's position is that there are people in this world that

[01:57:10] can provide experiences for you and safely

[01:57:14] for people that are in that kind of a group and that makes

[01:57:17] sense it makes sense that if you pay people enough and you

[01:57:21] have people motivated in order to like establish these

[01:57:24] relationships and make sure that these things happen when you get very high-profile

[01:57:28] you can't just be on a [ __ ] dating app and if you're a guy who likes to bank checks

[01:57:32] what are you going to do I the um all of that

[01:57:35] might be true but I I I wonder if there are more straightforward

[01:57:40] alternate conspiracy theories on Epstein that we're missing so let me do

[01:57:43] let me do alternate one on Bill Gates where um

[01:57:48] the um you know the things just just

[01:57:51] looking at what's hiding in plain sight um you know he

[01:57:55] supposedly um talked to um

[01:57:59] Epstein early on about um how his marriage

[01:58:02] wasn't doing that well and then Epstein suggested that he should

[01:58:06] get a divorce Circa 2010 2011 and Gates

[01:58:10] told him something like um you know um

[01:58:13] uh that doesn't quite work um didn't

[01:58:17] have presumably because he didn't have a prenup so

[01:58:21] um so there's one part of Epstein as a marriage counselor which is

[01:58:24] sort of disturbing um but then um the

[01:58:28] second thing that we know that um that Gates talked to

[01:58:31] to Epstein about was um sort of uh

[01:58:35] you know all the sort of collaborating on funding setting up this philanthropy

[01:58:39] all this sort of this um somewhat corrupt

[01:58:43] left-wing philanthropy structures and so there's a question you

[01:58:47] know um um does

[01:58:50] and then and then my sort of straightforward alternate

[01:58:54] conspiracy theory is um should we ask

[01:58:58] um should we ask should we combine those

[01:59:01] two and uh was there was there you

[01:59:05] know and I I don't have all the details in this figured out but it

[01:59:08] would be something like you know um Bill

[01:59:12] and Melinda get married in 1994 they don't sign a prup

[01:59:16] um and you know something's going wrong with

[01:59:19] the marriage and maybe Melinda can get

[01:59:23] half the money in a in a divorce he doesn't

[01:59:26] want her to get half the money what do you do and

[01:59:30] um uh and then the alternate plan is something

[01:59:33] like um you set up you set up

[01:59:37] uh you commit the marital assets

[01:59:41] to this nonprofit and um and then it

[01:59:45] it sort of locks Melinda into not complaining about

[01:59:48] the marriage for a long long time and it's and and

[01:59:52] it's it's some kind of a um and

[01:59:55] and so there's something about the left-wing philanthropy world

[01:59:59] that was uh it was sort of some sort of Boomer

[02:00:03] way to control their crazy wives or something like

[02:00:08] this it's also an effective way to whiteash your

[02:00:12] your past right your thought there all these and he

[02:00:15] he talked to Epstein about he got Epstein to meet with the uh the head of

[02:00:19] the Nobel Prize foundation so it was um yeah Bill

[02:00:22] Gates wanted to get a Nobel Nobel Prize wow right so

[02:00:26] this is all this is all yeah this is all straightforward this

[02:00:30] is all known yeah and and and I'm not saying what you're

[02:00:33] saying about do you know the history of the Nobel Prize that's the ultimate whitewash

[02:00:37] sure it was preventing Dynamite yeah that's the he was

[02:00:41] he well Peter Berg told me the story I was blown away he

[02:00:44] originally um they act

[02:00:48] someone said that he died and it was printed that he died but he didn't die

[02:00:52] and in the stories they were calling him The Merchant of death

[02:00:55] cuz he was the guy that invented dynamite and he re realized that oh my God I this is

[02:00:59] my reputation this is how think people think about me I have to do something

[02:01:02] to turn this around so he invented the Nobel Prize and he

[02:01:06] started then now the the name Nobel

[02:01:10] is automatically connected in most people's eyes to the the greatest

[02:01:14] people amongst us the people that have contributed the most to society and science

[02:01:17] and art and peace and all these different things Nobel

[02:01:21] Prize for medicine the

[02:01:24] guy who invented super crazy history yeah it's a crazy history

[02:01:28] but it's the ultimate whitewash it's the same thing like he came up with

[02:01:31] that prize because he wanted to change his image

[02:01:35] publicly and um so it's ironic that Bill Gates would want to get a Nobel

[02:01:39] Prize um or not iron or ironic but

[02:01:43] understandable and ironic but but I think but

[02:01:46] then if we if we uh if and so there's

[02:01:50] yeah so there's there's underage sex version of the

[02:01:54] Epstein story and then there is a crazy status

[02:01:58] Nobel Prize history of it and there is a corrupt leftwing

[02:02:02] philanthropy one and there is a uh Boomers

[02:02:05] who didn't sign um prenuptual agreements with their their wives

[02:02:10] story right and um and and

[02:02:13] I think all those are worth exploring more I think you're right what is

[02:02:17] what about the these leftwing philanthropy Ventures do

[02:02:21] you think is uniquely

[02:02:30] corrupt

[02:02:35] um sorry which one do I think is most corrupt or

[02:02:38] what what about them these when when you said corrupt

[02:02:43] yeah well um

[02:02:52] man it's it's there's something

[02:02:55] about it's maybe it's just my hermeneutic of Suspicion

[02:02:59] but there's something about you know there's

[02:03:02] something about the virtue signaling and

[02:03:06] what does it mean and I always think this is sort of a Europe

[02:03:11] America versus Europe difference where in um

[02:03:14] America we're told that um

[02:03:19] um that philanthropy is something a good person does

[02:03:23] and um you know if you're a Rockefeller or and

[02:03:26] you start giving away all your money um this is just this is just

[02:03:30] what um a good person does and it shows how good you are

[02:03:34] and then I think sort of the European intuition on it is something

[02:03:38] like um you know wow um that's

[02:03:42] it's only something a very evil person does and if you if you start

[02:03:45] giving away all your money in Europe it's like Joe you must have

[02:03:49] murdered somebody or you must you must be covered up for something so

[02:03:52] there these two very different intuitions and

[02:03:57] I think I think the European one is more correct than

[02:04:00] the American one and uh probably there's

[02:04:04] some history where um you know

[02:04:08] the sort of left-wing philanthropy peaked in 2007

[02:04:11] 2010 2012 and there's these

[02:04:15] subtle ways you know we've um we've become

[02:04:19] you know we've become more you know more more um

[02:04:22] more European in our sensibilities as a society and so it

[02:04:26] has this very different veence from what it did uh

[02:04:30] 12 or 14 years ago but yeah it's all

[02:04:34] we we ask all these questions like we're asking right now about Bill Gates where it's like

[02:04:38] okay he was you know it was like all the testimony in

[02:04:41] the Microsoft antitrust trial in the 90s where he's like he's cutting off the air

[02:04:45] supply he wants to strangle people and he's like not he's

[02:04:48] kind of a sociopathic guy it seems and then it's it's

[02:04:52] it's this giant whitewashing operation and and then somehow the whitewashing

[02:04:56] has been made too transparent and uh it gets deconstructed

[02:05:00] and exposed by you know the internet or whatever but I think most people are still

[02:05:04] unaware of how much whitewashing actually took place including donating

[02:05:08] somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 plus million dollars to

[02:05:11] Media corporations essentially buying favorable

[02:05:15] uh reviews about him and then there's this very public

[02:05:18] philanthropy it's not just philanthropy it's philanthropy mixed

[02:05:22] with public relations public Rel um relations

[02:05:26] because he's constantly doing interviews about it this is not like a guy who

[02:05:29] is just silently donating his incredible wealth to

[02:05:33] all these causes he's advocating for it on various talk shows

[02:05:36] he's constantly talking about it and how we need to do things

[02:05:40] I mean during the pandemic he was a very vocal voice he was the guy telling

[02:05:44] us he was a somehow or another he became a public health expert

[02:05:48] and no one questioned why we were taking Public Health advice from some

[02:05:51] someone who has a financial interest in this one very particular

[02:05:55] remedy yeah or

[02:05:59] um yeah there all these alternate versions I can give but

[02:06:03] yeah I I think um I think

[02:06:07] uh it's so it's always so hard to know what's really going on in our culture

[02:06:11] though so I I think I think all what you say is

[02:06:15] true but I also think it's not working

[02:06:19] as well as it used to Ag and there's a way people

[02:06:23] see through this it's not always as articulate as you

[02:06:26] just articulated it but there's there's

[02:06:30] some there's some vague intuition that um

[02:06:34] you know um you know when Mr Gates

[02:06:38] is just wearing uh sweaters and looks like Mr Rogers that

[02:06:41] something fishy is going on people people have that sort of in trust Jeff

[02:06:45] Bezos in his tight shirt hanging out with his girlfriend on the yach or Elon

[02:06:49] Elon Musk uh the vice signaling is safer than virtue

[02:06:53] signaling yeah right because if you're you know if your

[02:06:57] virtue signaling are intuition is something

[02:07:01] really really really sketchy suspicious we get suspicious and I think

[02:07:04] rightly so I think especially when someone's doing something so public

[02:07:08] I think rightly we should be suspicious especially when I mean with with Gates

[02:07:12] it's like you know the history of the guy I mean you know what he was involved with

[02:07:15] before you know how he ran Microsoft you know it just

[02:07:19] kind of makes sense that it's a clever movie move it's a clever move to

[02:07:23] pay the media it's a clever move again my my my my alternate

[02:07:26] one which is not incompatible with yours on on on Gates is that

[02:07:30] uh um Melinda finally files for divorce in early

[02:07:34] 21 um I think she told Bill she wanted one

[02:07:38] late 2019 so 2020 the year where

[02:07:42] um he Bill Gates goes into overdrive on

[02:07:46] covid um you know um all this stuff

[02:07:51] you know part part of it maybe it's self-dealing and he's trying to make money

[02:07:54] from the drug company or something like this but um

[02:07:58] you know isn't isn't the other really big thing

[02:08:02] he needs to box Melinda in and force

[02:08:06] her not to get that much out because all the money's going to the

[02:08:09] foundation anyway Melinda has to say um

[02:08:13] you know um I want why do you want half the money it's all

[02:08:17] going to the Gates Foundation anyway we're not leaving our kids anything

[02:08:21] and um and then when you lean into Co

[02:08:24] you know how does that work in the you know it's somehow

[02:08:29] um in theory Melinda has a really strong hand she should get half

[02:08:32] that's what you get in a divorce with um no prenuptial but then

[02:08:36] if you make it go overdrive on Co Melinda

[02:08:40] are you a you know are you a I don't know

[02:08:44] uh are you like some crazy anti-science

[02:08:48] person right and um and so so I don't know

[02:08:51] my my my my my my

[02:08:55] reconstruction is that uh you should not underestimate how much of

[02:08:58] it was you know about just controlling his

[02:09:02] ex-wife and and not about controlling the whole society makes

[02:09:05] sense it makes sense you they

[02:09:09] can both be they can both be correct sure there there's many factors but

[02:09:13] mine mine lines up really well with the with the timeline well we're

[02:09:16] probably talking about a hundred million doll or hundred billion dollars one way

[02:09:20] or the other well I think she got got she got less than she got like one tenth

[02:09:24] really interesting and she should have gotten half as far

[02:09:27] as and I it's amazing he got it down that much WoW

[02:09:31] interesting but it was just I think she was just boxed in every time he

[02:09:35] went on TV talking about Co she was boxed in

[02:09:38] with all of her leftwing friends that is an interesting

[02:09:43] philosophy that's an interesting way to approach a problem if you're

[02:09:47] him very wise you know very clever I mean if

[02:09:50] you're just looking at like just for personal benefit the

[02:09:54] genius move and the guy's a genius clearly brilliant guy

[02:09:58] you know I mean that makes sense makes sense that he would do that I don't

[02:10:01] know you know I would do that probably should have had a prup but

[02:10:06] yeah yeah well that's kind of crazy that's interesting that

[02:10:09] yeah I didn't consider that but it makes sense and she's you

[02:10:13] know she's been kind of pretty vocal unfortunately for him about his

[02:10:17] ties to Epstein being one of the primary reasons why she wanted out

[02:10:20] but again my Al again it's what did he

[02:10:24] was he was he was he having extramarital Affairs

[02:10:28] through Epstein or maybe Epstein was from Melinda's point

[02:10:31] of view would it be worse for Epstein to facilitate an extramarital affair

[02:10:35] or would it be worse for Epstein to be advising Gates on

[02:10:39] how to how to ditch Melinda without giving her

[02:10:43] any money what do you think he was that would be much much worse from a Linda's point of view

[02:10:47] yeah makes sense it totally makes sense do you think that he was a legitimate

[02:10:50] finan adviser like he could give him advice on how to do those things

[02:10:54] that Gates wouldn't have more effective people

[02:10:58] I mean he's when you're at that level of wealth I'm sure you have wealth management

[02:11:01] people that are like very high

[02:11:05] level

[02:11:09] um because that's one of the things that Eric said about him he said when he met him

[02:11:13] he's like this guy's a fraud like this he doesn't know enough about

[02:11:17] what he's talking about and you know Eric is you know I I I met Epstein

[02:11:22] a a few times as well and I think

[02:11:26] how'd you get introduced um it was uh it was Reed

[02:11:29] Hoffman and Silicon Valley introduced us in 2014 but

[02:11:33] um but it was it was basically

[02:11:37] uh and I I you know I didn't didn't

[02:11:41] uh check didn't ask any enough questions about it

[02:11:45] um but I yeah

[02:11:49] I I think there were sort of a lot of things where it was was fraudulent

[02:11:52] I do think Epstein knew a lot about taxes

[02:11:56] and um and there were probably you know

[02:12:00] these these complicated ways you could um

[02:12:04] you could structure a nonprofit

[02:12:08] organization especially as a way in in a in a

[02:12:12] marital cont context that uh

[02:12:15] that I I think Epstein might have might have known a decent amount about how

[02:12:19] when you were introduced to him I don't I don't think Epstein would have been able to

[02:12:23] um you know comment on super String Theory

[02:12:27] something like that but uh but I think I think this sort of

[02:12:31] thing he he might have actually been pretty expert on when you were introduced to

[02:12:34] him what how was he described to you um he was

[02:12:38] described as uh one of the smartest tax people in the world

[02:12:42] interesting and uh and I I probably probably was

[02:12:45] my moral weakness that I how could you have known back then he had never been arrested

[02:12:50] no this was this was post 2014 was post arrest oh so his arrest was

[02:12:53] the first arrest right which was like 200 78

[02:12:57] okay okay and so but you know you you assume

[02:13:01] um he didn't go to jail for that long right it was probably not

[02:13:05] not as serious as alleged uh there was was certainly was the illusion

[02:13:09] that there were all these these other people that I trusted

[02:13:13] you know Reed who introduced us was you know he started LinkedIn

[02:13:17] he was you know maybe too focused on business

[02:13:20] Network working but but uh but I thought he always had good

[02:13:24] judgment in people when the [ __ ] went down and epine gets arrested

[02:13:28] for the second time were you like oh well there you go

[02:13:33] uh I've thought about it I thought a lot about it as a result yeah

[02:13:37] yeah I'm sure Jesus Christ well he tricked a lot of

[02:13:40] people I know a lot of people that met that guy

[02:13:44] he got a lot of celebrities to come to his house for parties and things well I think

[02:13:48] I think it was it's it was it's a

[02:13:52] I think a lot of it was this was this strange commentary

[02:13:55] on you know I know it was some secret Club secret

[02:13:59] society you could be part of right of course again that

[02:14:02] wasn't it wasn't explicit but that was that was the vague vague Vibe of

[02:14:06] the whole thing people love those stupid things they love like exclusive

[02:14:10] clubs that very few people look at the [ __ ] Soho House like look at

[02:14:13] that stupid thing I mean you just go to a place that you have to be a member to go to and everybody

[02:14:17] wants to be a member oh my God got get and then you got like the Malibu

[02:14:21] Soho house it's different from the other ones you have to have membership only there

[02:14:25] do you have membership there people love that kind of [ __ ] socially

[02:14:29] they love being a part of a Walled Garden they love it

[02:14:33] they love it and if you're a guy like Bill Gates or or or

[02:14:36] similarly wealthy you probably have a very small amount of people that you can relate

[02:14:40] to very small amount of people that you can trust probably very difficult

[02:14:43] to form new friendships yeah I I I think there were probably

[02:14:47] different different things that were pitched for different people sure

[02:14:51] you know I I was I was pitched on the taxes I think

[02:14:55] you know there were probably other people that were you know more

[02:14:59] um more prone to the you know um the

[02:15:02] Social Club part and then there were probably people yeah and there was probably

[02:15:07] a fairly limited group where it was uh

[02:15:10] yeah off off the charts bad wouldn't it be wonderful to know what the [ __ ] was

[02:15:14] really going on and maybe one day we will maybe one day some Whitney web

[02:15:18] type character will break it all down to us and explain do us in great

[02:15:21] detail exactly how this was formulated and what they were doing and how they were

[02:15:25] getting information out of people but I think people have to age out they have to

[02:15:29] they have to die and we we still don't have it on the Kennedy assassination JFK

[02:15:33] crazy well one of the wildest Things That Trump said was that if they told you

[02:15:36] what they told me you wouldn't tell people either

[02:15:40] which is like what the [ __ ] does that mean what does

[02:15:44] that mean I don't think legally he can tell you

[02:15:47] right because I think those things are Above Top Secret if if

[02:15:51] they did inform him of something there must be some sort of prerequisite

[02:15:54] to keeping this a secret

[02:15:58] I I I haven't studied that one that carefully but

[02:16:02] isn't you know there all these alternate conspiracy

[02:16:06] theories on who killed JFK it's you know the CIA

[02:16:10] and the mafia and the Russians and the Cubans and um

[02:16:13] you know um there's an LBJ version since he's the one

[02:16:17] who benefited so all these happened in Texas

[02:16:21] um uh you have all these you know alternate

[02:16:24] theories and on some level it's it's it's yeah it's it's

[02:16:29] I always think it's just a commentary where you know 1963 America wasn't it

[02:16:32] wasn't like Leave it to Beaver it was it was like a really crazy

[02:16:36] country underneath the surface and absolutely um and even

[02:16:39] though probably most of the conspiracy theories are wrong it was like murder on the

[02:16:43] oran Express and all these people sort of had different reasons for

[02:16:47] wanting Kennedy dead and that's that's what the theories are right even if they're

[02:16:51] wrong on the level of factual detail and then

[02:16:54] the the the sort of more minimal one that I'm I'm

[02:16:58] open to and I think there's some evidence in this from

[02:17:02] from the stuff that has been that has uh come out is

[02:17:06] you know Oswald was talking to

[02:17:10] you know parts of the US deep State and so even if

[02:17:14] Oswald was the Lan assassin and you somehow get the magic bullet

[02:17:17] theory and all that stuff to work but let's say Oswald was the loan ass pass

[02:17:22] did did he did he tell someone in the FBI

[02:17:25] or CIA you know I'm going to I'm going to go kill Kennedy tomorrow

[02:17:29] and then you know maybe maybe the CIA didn't

[02:17:33] have to kill him they just didn't had to do nothing just had a sit on it or

[02:17:37] or maybe was too incompetent and didn't get you know didn't go up the

[02:17:40] bureaucracy and so it's you know I

[02:17:44] I think we sort of know that they they talked to Oswald

[02:17:48] you know a fair amount before before it happened

[02:17:52] and uh and so there's at least something

[02:17:56] you know that was grossly incompetent I think people have a

[02:18:00] problem minimum with with two stories being mut mutually exclusive

[02:18:04] two stories being the lone gunman or the CIA killed Kennedy

[02:18:08] and then they these they're not connected I think Lee Harvey Oswell was a part of

[02:18:11] it I think I think he probably did shoot that cop there's some

[02:18:15] evidence that you when when he was on the run and he was confronted you

[02:18:18] know there was a cop that that got shot and were alleging he he he might have done it

[02:18:23] he might have taken a shot at Kennedy he might have even hit him

[02:18:26] I don't think he was the only one shooting I I think the

[02:18:30] the vast there was an enormous amount of people

[02:18:33] that heard sounds coming from the grassy null they heard gunfire

[02:18:37] they reportedly saw people the amount of people

[02:18:41] that were witnesses to the Kennedy assassination that died mysterious

[02:18:44] deaths is pretty shocking um Jack Ruby

[02:18:48] Well Jack Ruby just that's a weird one right Oswald yeah

[02:18:52] Jack Ruby walks up to Oswald shoots him and then Jack Ruby with no

[02:18:55] previous history of mental illness becomes completely insane after getting visited

[02:19:00] by Jolly West which is nuts like why is the guy who's the head

[02:19:03] of MK Ultra visiting the guy who shot the Assassin of the

[02:19:07] president and why is he left alone with them what what happens what

[02:19:10] does he give him that this guy is screaming out they're burning Jews alive

[02:19:14] and just crazy crazy [ __ ] he was yelling out

[02:19:18] he went nuts probably some some amount of usty that dangerous

[02:19:22] enormous amount they probably gave him a [ __ ] glass of it they

[02:19:25] probably gave him a glass of it and told him it was water drink this and

[02:19:29] who [ __ ] knows but the point is

[02:19:32] I think I think it's very possible that Oswald was a part of it

[02:19:37] and the way they did it and the way they just shot Oswald

[02:19:41] and and then they write the warrant commission we don't even see

[02:19:45] the zuder film until 12 years later

[02:19:49] when haraldo Rivera and when they play it on television

[02:19:53] when um Dick Gregory brought it to Heraldo Rivera which is wild a comedian

[02:19:57] brings the video the the the actual film rather

[02:20:01] of the assassination from a different angle well you can actually see the video of him

[02:20:04] getting shot and his his head snaps back and to the left and everybody's like

[02:20:08] what the [ __ ] is going on here um when you

[02:20:11] look at all that stuff this mirrors what

[02:20:15] happened with this Crooks kid this Crooks kid somehow

[02:20:19] or another gets to the top of the roof is spotted by these people

[02:20:22] they know he's there they know he has a rifle they see him walking

[02:20:26] around the crime scene half

[02:20:30] an hour before with a rangefinder the the whole thing

[02:20:33] is bananas and then they go to his house after he's killed

[02:20:37] it's completely scrubbed there's no silverware there they know

[02:20:40] that there's ad data that shows that a phone that's coming from the

[02:20:44] FBI offices in DC had visited him on

[02:20:47] multiple occasions cuz they tracked ad data there's

[02:20:51] and if that guy if he shot Trump and Trump got murdered and

[02:20:55] then they shot him it would be the Kennedy assassination

[02:20:59] all over again everybody would going what the [ __ ] happened

[02:21:02] what happened what was the motivation what was he on any drugs

[02:21:06] what's the toxicology report how did he get up there who knew he

[02:21:10] was up there how how did they not shoot him quicker like what the [ __ ]

[02:21:13] happened how was he able to get off three shots what happened and go

[02:21:17] I I think there's like a slightly less crazy that might

[02:21:21] still be true which is just that uh people

[02:21:24] in the Secret Service in the um Biden Administration

[02:21:28] don't like Trump and it's they didn't have full

[02:21:32] intention to kill him but it's just they didn't protect him we're just we're

[02:21:36] just you know we're going to have we're going to underst staff it

[02:21:40] we're um we're not going to we don't have to do as good a job coordinating

[02:21:43] with the local police there's all these ways you know

[02:21:47] um to make someone less safe you know but it seems more than that if they

[02:21:51] if they knew that the guy was on the roof with a rifle that seems a little more than

[02:21:54] that it's always a question who they is though right well

[02:21:58] if I'm a sniper and I'm on people people in the audience people there

[02:22:01] were people there tell telling it to people right but I think the authorities

[02:22:05] knew this guy was on the roof before as well um well

[02:22:09] I I I I suspect some of the Secret Service people were were

[02:22:13] told that and then who knows how

[02:22:16] that got relayed or who all snipers already have eye on

[02:22:20] him I believe the snipers already had eye on I I don't know

[02:22:24] find out if that's true Jamie find out the snipers had eye on SEC

[02:22:27] service I don't know about the snipers I I I I I don't I don't know about

[02:22:31] uh the the thing I don't have a good sense on with

[02:22:35] uh with with with shooting and maybe maybe you'd have a better

[02:22:39] feel for this is my my senses was a pretty

[02:22:42] straightforward shot for for the guy in um the Trump assassin

[02:22:46] would be assassin I think the Oswalt shot was a much harder one

[02:22:50] because Kennedy's moving yes and no yes and no

[02:22:54] okay because uh Oswald had a scope so Oswald

[02:22:58] had a rifle the marono rifle say

[02:23:01] one of the snipers stationed inside the building reported first saw Crooks outside

[02:23:05] and looking up to the roof of the building before the suspect left the scene crook Slater

[02:23:09] came back and sat down while looking at his phone near the building CBS News reported that a sniper

[02:23:13] took a photo of the suspect when he returned but I think they saw him on the

[02:23:16] roof though um krooks then took out a rang finder

[02:23:21] like right then arrest that guy you got a [ __ ]

[02:23:24] Rangefinder about the suspect's action Crooks then disappeared again and

[02:23:28] returned to the building with a backpack again arrest him

[02:23:32] Secret Service snipers again alerted their command post about Crook's actions

[02:23:36] according to the source who spoke with CBS News Crooks had already climbed

[02:23:39] to the top of the building in question by the time the additional officers arrived at the scene for

[02:23:43] backup the suspect also positioned himself above and

[02:23:47] behind the snipers inside the building by the time the police started

[02:23:50] rushing the scene and other officers attempted to get onto the roof the source

[02:23:54] told CBS news that a different Secret Service sniper had killed Crooks

[02:23:58] okay so it seems like they they [ __ ] bumbled it

[02:24:02] at every step of the way if they knew that guy was there if they knew he had a rangef finder returns

[02:24:06] to the backpack he gets onto the roof all that's insane

[02:24:09] that is at the very least horrific incompetence

[02:24:14] at the very least let me go back yeah okay but back to Mike

[02:24:17] was it I I thought it was a much easier shot for it's not an easy head

[02:24:21] shot um he's shooting at his head but why why why

[02:24:25] why was shooting at the head the right thing shouldn't you be shooting at well you don't know if he wearing a vest

[02:24:29] right um he could be wearing a vest which you would have to

[02:24:32] have plates you'd have to have uh ceramic plates in order to stop

[02:24:36] a a a rifle round so was was it a 308

[02:24:40] what what did he have what kind of rifle did he have I have never

[02:24:44] seen that I think he had an AR-15 so and are are

[02:24:48] the Scopes a lot better today than he have we're pretty sure

[02:24:52] how good was Oswell scope it was good they said it was off

[02:24:56] this was one of the the conspiracy theories uh oh the scope was off

[02:25:00] but that doesn't mean anything because Scopes can get off when you pick it up if you

[02:25:03] knock it against the wall when he drops it if you makes the shot and then

[02:25:07] drops the scope and the scope hits the window sill and then bounces off that's

[02:25:11] excuse me that Scopes off anytime you knock is there anything about

[02:25:15] the high angle from Oswald made it harder no not a difficult shot

[02:25:19] very difficult to get off three shots very quickly so that was the thing that they had attributed

[02:25:23] three shots to Oswald the reason why they had attributed three shots is because one of

[02:25:26] them had hit a Ricochet one of them had gone into the underpass

[02:25:30] ricocheted off the curb and hit a man who was treated at a hospital they found

[02:25:34] that they found out where had hit the bulleted hit so they knew that one bullet Miss Kennedy

[02:25:38] hit that curb which would have indicated that someone shot from a

[02:25:42] similar position as Lee Harvey Oswell um so then

[02:25:45] they had the one wound that uh Kennedy had to the

[02:25:49] head of course and then they had another wound that Kennedy had uh through

[02:25:53] his neck that's the magic bullet theory this is why they had to come up with the magic

[02:25:56] bullet theory cuz they had tribute all these wounds to one bullet then

[02:26:00] they find this pristine bullet they find it in the gurnie

[02:26:04] when they're bringing uh Governor Connelly in

[02:26:07] nonsense it's total nonsense the bullet is undeformed

[02:26:11] a bullet that goes through two people and leaves more fragments

[02:26:15] of the bullet in connell's wrist that are missing

[02:26:18] from the bullet itself and then the bullets not deformed after shattering

[02:26:22] bone all that's crazy all that defies

[02:26:26] logic that doesn't make any sense if you know anything about bullets and if

[02:26:29] you shoot bullets into things they distort it's just one of the things that

[02:26:33] happen um that bullet looks like someone shot it into a swimming pool that's what

[02:26:37] it looks like when they would do ballistics on on bullets and they try to figure

[02:26:40] out like if it was this guy's gun or that guy's gun and by the rifling of

[02:26:44] the round they can get similar markings on bullets when

[02:26:47] they do that that's how they do it they do it so the Bullet doesn't distort so they shoot that

[02:26:51] bullet into uh water or something like that now that bullet was

[02:26:55] uh metal jacketed right if you look at the bullet the top of it

[02:26:59] is uh [ __ ] up and but the the shape of the bullet looks

[02:27:02] pretty perfect it doesn't look like something that shattered bones

[02:27:06] and then you have to attribute you have to account rather for the amount

[02:27:10] of per there's little fragments of the bullet that you could see

[02:27:14] that they found in connell's wrist the whole thing's nuts

[02:27:18] the whole thing's nuts that you're only saying that this one guy did it

[02:27:21] because that's convenient and the Warren commission's the Warren Commission

[02:27:25] whitewashed everything so the whole thing's nuts it's much more likely that

[02:27:29] there were people in the grassy null and then the umbrellas

[02:27:32] as the pointers or whatever I mean I don't know I don't know about

[02:27:36] what all I know is you got a guy in a convertible which is [ __ ] crazy

[02:27:40] who is the president of the United States and he's going slowly

[02:27:44] down a road now if you are in a prone position so Oswald

[02:27:48] is uh on the window sill right which is a great place to shoot by the way

[02:27:52] it's a great place to shoot cuz you rest that gun on the window sill

[02:27:55] and if you rest it on the window sill there's no movement right so you wrap your

[02:27:59] arm around the sling if it had a sling I'm not sure if it did so you get a nice tight grip

[02:28:03] you shove it up against your shoulder you rest it on the window

[02:28:06] sill and all you have to do is you have a round already racked

[02:28:10] all and you have a scope and so the scope's magnified all you have to do is wait

[02:28:14] until he's there you lead him just a little bit and squeeze one off and

[02:28:17] then boom boom you could do that

[02:28:21] pretty quick it's not outside of the

[02:28:24] realm of possibility that he did get off three shots what doesn't make

[02:28:28] sense is the backing to the left it doesn't make sense that

[02:28:32] all these other people saw people shooting from the grassy

[02:28:35] null there's all these people that saw people running away they saw

[02:28:39] smoke there's smoke in some photographs of it it looks like

[02:28:43] there was more than one shooter and it looks like they tried to they tried to

[02:28:47] hide that they tried to hide that in the warrant commission report the shot

[02:28:50] to Kennedy's neck initially was in

[02:28:54] when they brought him in in Dallas when he was before they shipped him to Bethesda

[02:28:59] they said that that was an entry wound when he got to Bethesda

[02:29:02] then it became a tracheotomy why do you give a tracheotomy to a guy who doesn't have a head

[02:29:06] you don't I mean that just none of it makes any sense they altered the

[02:29:10] autopsy this is a part of David lon's book best evidence

[02:29:14] um Kennedy's brain wasn't even in his body when they buried him

[02:29:18] like the the the whole thing is very strange but then do

[02:29:22] do you get to anything more concrete than my murder on the orian express

[02:29:25] where they're just you know it could have been a lot of people could the Russians

[02:29:29] the Cubans the well no one even got suspicious for 12

[02:29:34] years I think people were susp a lot of people suspicious

[02:29:38] kind of but what do you have to go on you don't have to go on anything like this Crooks kid

[02:29:42] we don't have anything to go on we're just going to be left out here just like we're left out

[02:29:45] here with the the Epstein information no one knows the

[02:29:49] people that whoever organized it if anyone did you're never

[02:29:53] going to hear about it it's just going to go away the news Cycle's just going to keep flooded with

[02:29:56] more nonsense and and I think there's probably a bunch

[02:30:00] of people that wanted Kennedy dead I think there was more than one group of people that wanted

[02:30:04] Kennedy dead I think there's probably collusion between groups that wanted Kennedy dead

[02:30:07] and I think there's a lot of people that have vested interest in ending his presidency

[02:30:11] and I think he was dangerous he was dangerous to a lot of the powers it be he was dangerous

[02:30:15] his his famous speech about secret societies crazy

[02:30:19] speech guy has this speech and then gets murdered right afterwards kind of nuts

[02:30:23] like the whole thing's nuts he wanted to get rid of the CIA

[02:30:26] he wanted to I mean there was so many things that Kennedy wanted to do there were

[02:30:30] also a lot of crazy things Kennedy was doing you know so

[02:30:34] you know the um the the Cuba version

[02:30:37] of the assassination theory was um you know we had the Cuban Missile Crisis in 62

[02:30:41] about a year earlier and then the deal that we struck

[02:30:45] with the Soviets was um you know um they

[02:30:49] take the missiles out of Cuba and we promised we wouldn't um

[02:30:52] we wouldn't try to overthrow the government in Cuba

[02:30:57] and uh and I guess we you know we no longer did

[02:31:01] um you know we no longer did Bay of Pigs type covert

[02:31:05] stuff like that but I think there were still something like four or five

[02:31:09] assassination plots on Fidel yeah attempts actual attempts and

[02:31:12] then I think there was I don't know I think that again I'm going to get this garbled I think

[02:31:16] a month or two before the JFK assassination it

[02:31:20] castra said something like you know um there might be repercussions

[02:31:24] if you keep doing this yeah well listen I'm sure there's a

[02:31:27] lot of people that wanted that guy dead and I'm sure they would coordinate I mean if

[02:31:31] you knew that Cuba wanted Kennedy dead and you knew

[02:31:34] that Cuba can get you assassins or that they could help in in any

[02:31:38] way you I'm sure they would want as many people that knew for a

[02:31:42] fact they wanted him dead and had communicated that I mean back

[02:31:45] then they were doing wild [ __ ] man I mean this is when they were doing operation

[02:31:49] Northwood this again where I think I think I think it

[02:31:54] is I don't think we're in a world where zero stuff is happening

[02:31:58] I I still I still uh the place where I directionally

[02:32:02] have a different feel for it is I think um so much less

[02:32:06] of the stuff is going on and it's it's so much harder in this internet

[02:32:10] world for people to hide with whistleblowers as well and their legacy

[02:32:14] programs and there are internal records that are being kept and

[02:32:18] um you know like I I I don't know this for sure but

[02:32:21] I think even the NSA fisa court stuff which was an

[02:32:25] outof control deep State thing that was going on through about 2016

[02:32:29] 2017 I suspect even that at this point

[02:32:33] you know can't quite work because people know

[02:32:37] that they're being watched they know they're being recorded

[02:32:40] and it's it's just you know you know you can't do

[02:32:44] water boarding in Guantanamo if you have lawyers running all over the

[02:32:48] place correct and that's I hope you're correct but it brings me

[02:32:52] back to this whole idea of getting dirt then I think I think there's

[02:32:56] and then on the other hand there's also um you know

[02:33:00] a degree to which um our government our

[02:33:04] our deep State um across the board is

[02:33:08] shockingly less competent less functional

[02:33:12] and um it's less capable of this and this is this is where I'm

[02:33:15] not even sure whether this is an improvement you know right so it's it's sort of

[02:33:19] like um you know um maybe um

[02:33:23] the 1963 us

[02:33:27] where let's go with the craziest version where our deep state is capable

[02:33:31] of knocking off the president maybe that's actually a

[02:33:34] higher functioning Society than uh than the uh

[02:33:39] than um the crazy version where they are they're incapable

[02:33:43] of doing it right and they're bogged down with Dei they can't they

[02:33:46] they can't they can't get the gunman even to have a scope on his rifle or whatever

[02:33:50] yeah I don't we we haven't really totally figured out had scope on his

[02:33:54] rifle but I don't believe he did man it's like it's like much

[02:33:57] bigger loser can you find someone as competent as Oswalt

[02:34:01] right or something like that you know yeah it's a good point it's a good point

[02:34:05] and so I I um I I I'm I I Veer more to the

[02:34:08] explanation that it's uh it's gross

[02:34:12] incompetence but I I don't know if that makes it better it might make

[02:34:16] it worse I think they weren't as competent right

[02:34:19] because they only had one guy doing it and he wasn't effective

[02:34:23] if you had the same if if you had much better

[02:34:27] organization you wouldn't have it just one guy I mean there's people out

[02:34:30] there that I know that can kill someone from a mile

[02:34:34] away but it's it it's it's very effective you you can you can do

[02:34:38] things as a solo actor it's it's hard to organize because everything

[02:34:41] gets recorded everything does get recorded that is a fact but it brings

[02:34:45] me back to that thing about having dirt on people that you were talking about with why

[02:34:48] the Epstein information doesn't get released and why they probably did it in the

[02:34:52] first place they did it in the first place you have dirt on people then you know those

[02:34:56] people are not going to tell on you you all coordinate together that is that is

[02:34:59] still a that is still a strange Counterpoint to my thesis

[02:35:03] where why has the dirt not come out and so somehow there's some

[02:35:07] some way uh the container is still kind of working

[02:35:11] yeah it's kind of working it's just everyone is aware that it's working and then

[02:35:14] they frustrated that nothing happens you know like Julian Assange being

[02:35:18] arrested and and spending so much time locked up in the embassy like

[02:35:22] finally recently released but didn't he have to delete like a bunch of emails

[02:35:25] in order to be released but you know the you know in the in the

[02:35:29] but again just just to take the other side of this both in the Assange

[02:35:33] Snowden stuff um yeah it showed an outof control

[02:35:37] deep state that was just hoovering up all the data in

[02:35:41] the world right and then um but we weren't like it didn't

[02:35:45] show like James Bond times 100

[02:35:48] there W weren't like exploding cigar assassination plots

[02:35:52] there was none of we're doing so little with this

[02:35:56] is is um seems they don't or at least

[02:36:00] that's the um but you know

[02:36:04] it's I I think it's there's so much less agency in the

[02:36:07] CIA in the Central Intelligence Agency it's so much less agentic

[02:36:12] I hope you're right again I I don't know incorrect with

[02:36:15] how they deal with overseas stuff I hope they're really good at that um

[02:36:19] you know that brings me to this whole UAP thing because one of my primary

[02:36:23] theories about the UAP thing is it's stuff that we have I

[02:36:27] think I think that's a lot of what people are seeing I think I think there's

[02:36:30] secret programs um that are Beyond

[02:36:34] congressional oversight that have done

[02:36:38] some things with propulsion that's outside of our understanding

[02:36:41] our our current the conventional understanding that most people have

[02:36:45] about rockets and all these different things being the only way to propel things through the sky

[02:36:49] I think they figured out some other stuff and I think they're drones and I think they have

[02:36:53] drones that can use some sort of whether it's anti-gravity propulsion

[02:36:57] system or some you know so do you that's

[02:37:01] that's your that's your placeholder Theory or that's that's uh

[02:37:04] that's what you think more than space aliens or do you

[02:37:08] think both space aliens and that or which which version of this

[02:37:12] the ladder I think both you think both yeah I don't I don't think we haven't been

[02:37:15] visited I think we have I I think we if if life exists elsewhere

[02:37:19] where it most certainly should it just makes sense but do you do

[02:37:23] you do you think um do you think the UFO sightings from

[02:37:26] the 50s and 60s were already drone programs were they already that Advance no those

[02:37:30] are the ones that give me pause um that's why you know when I

[02:37:34] named my comedy club The Comedy Mothership it's all UFO themed our

[02:37:37] our rooms are named fat man and little boy our rooms are named

[02:37:41] after the nuclear bombs because those nuclear bombs when they drop them

[02:37:45] that's when everybody starts seeing these things and I think if I was a sophisticated

[02:37:49] Society from another planet and I recognized that there is an intelligent

[02:37:53] species that has developed nuclear power and has started using it as bombs

[02:37:57] I would immediately start visiting and I would let them know hey [ __ ]

[02:38:01] like there's there's something way more advanced than you I would hover over

[02:38:05] the nuclear bases and shut down their missiles I would do all the things that supposedly

[02:38:09] the UFOs did just to keep the government in check just to say

[02:38:13] Hey you are going through a transitionary period that all intelligent

[02:38:16] species do when they have the ability to harness incredible

[02:38:20] power and yet they still have these Prime primape brains

[02:38:24] they they have these territorial ape brains but yet now

[02:38:27] with the ability to literally harness the power of stars

[02:38:31] and drop them on cities I think that's when I would start visiting

[02:38:35] and I think all throughout human history before that even

[02:38:39] there's been very bizarre accounts of these

[02:38:43] things all the way back to Ezekiel in the Bible very

[02:38:46] bizarre accounts of these things that are flying through space Chariot

[02:38:50] yeah there's there's a bunch of them there's the vimanas and the ancient

[02:38:54] Hindu text there's there's so many of these things that you got to

[02:38:57] wonder and you got to think that if we send drones to

[02:39:01] Mars and we do we have a [ __ ] Rover running around

[02:39:04] on Mars right now collecting data do we send the James web telescope

[02:39:08] into space of course we do we have a lot of stuff that we send into space

[02:39:11] if we lived another million years without blowing ourselves up which

[02:39:15] is just a blink of an eye in terms of the life of some of the planets in the universe

[02:39:20] how how much more advanced would we be and if we were Interstellar

[02:39:24] and if we were Intergalactic Travelers and we found

[02:39:27] out that there was a primitive species that was coming of age I think we would start visiting

[02:39:31] them you know the let me think what

[02:39:35] my I hear everything you're saying I'm I'm I'm strangely

[02:39:39] under motivated by it even if even if it's plausible too

[02:39:43] believe it or not um

[02:39:47] and I guess I guess on the space Al which is the the Wilder more

[02:39:51] interesting one in a way you know I don't know Roswell was 77

[02:39:55] years ago 1947 and if

[02:39:59] um if

[02:40:02] um if the phenomenon is real and it's

[02:40:06] it's from another world it's space aliens space robots what whatever

[02:40:11] um you know probably one of the key

[02:40:14] features is its ephemerality or its cloaking

[02:40:18] and they are really good at hiding it at cloaking it

[02:40:23] at um scrambling people's brains after they see them

[02:40:26] or or stuff like this right and then um you know if

[02:40:30] you're a researcher you you have to pick Fields where you

[02:40:33] can make progress and so um

[02:40:37] this is um you know it's not a promising field in you know

[02:40:41] I know Academia is messed up but even if Academia were not messed up

[02:40:44] this would not be a good field in which to try to make a career because there's been

[02:40:48] so little PR R in 77 years and

[02:40:52] so you think of it from the point of view of I

[02:40:55] know jacqu valet or you know some of these people have been working on this for 50 years

[02:40:59] and um yeah it's it feels like there's something

[02:41:03] there and um but then it's it's just as soon as you

[02:41:07] as soon as you feel like you have something almost that's graspable

[02:41:11] like a Tik Tok videos whatever it just it's it's just

[02:41:15] always at the margin of recognition and it's the ephemerality

[02:41:19] is a is a key feature and um and then um

[02:41:23] you know maybe you have to then you have to I think you have to have some

[02:41:27] theory of you know why is this about to change and then

[02:41:30] it's always you know I don't know the abstract mathematical formulation would be

[02:41:34] you know um something um doesn't happen for time

[02:41:38] interval 0er to T and time interval t+

[02:41:42] one next minute next year How likely is it

[02:41:45] and maybe maybe there's a chance something will will happen

[02:41:49] you're waiting at the airport your luggage hasn't shown up it's more and more likely

[02:41:53] it shows up in the next minute but after an hour

[02:41:57] you know at some point the luggage is lost and if you're still waiting at the airport a year

[02:42:01] later that's a dumb idea at some point at some point the luggage

[02:42:04] is lost right and like you know it's I don't know 77

[02:42:08] years it's like maybe it's like 77 minutes at

[02:42:12] the airport that's at 77 minutes you should stop you know

[02:42:16] I I'd start getting very demotivated waiting for my luggage perhaps let

[02:42:19] me Al give you an alter alternative Theory now if you were

[02:42:23] a a highly sophisticated Society they understood the progression of technology

[02:42:27] and understood the uh biological evolution that these

[02:42:31] animals were going through and you realized that they had reached uh a level

[02:42:35] of intelligence that required them to be monitored

[02:42:38] or maybe you even helped them along the way and this is uh some of

[02:42:42] Diana P's work who uh uh works with

[02:42:46] uh with Gary Nolan on these things they they claim

[02:42:49] that they have recovered these crashed vehicles that

[02:42:53] defy any conventional understanding

[02:42:56] of how to construct things uh propulsion

[02:43:00] systems and they believe that these things are donations that's

[02:43:04] literally how they describe them as donations if you knew

[02:43:08] that this is a long road this is you can't just show up and

[02:43:11] give people time machines it's a long road for these

[02:43:15] people to develop the sophistication the cultural

[02:43:19] advancement the uh intellectual capacity

[02:43:23] to understand their place in the universe and that they're not there yet and they're still engaging

[02:43:27] in lies and manipulation and propaganda

[02:43:30] their entire Society is built on a Ship of Fools

[02:43:35] if you looked at that you would say they're not ready this is what we do

[02:43:38] we slowly introduce ourselves slowly over

[02:43:42] time make it more and more common and that's what you're seeing

[02:43:46] what you're seeing is when you have things like the tick talk

[02:43:50] uh the commander David fraver um incident off of the coast

[02:43:53] of San Diego in 2004 and then you have the

[02:43:57] the stuff that they found off the east coast where they were seeing these

[02:44:01] these uh cubes within a circle that were hovering

[02:44:05] motionless and 120 knot winds and taking off an insane race of speed

[02:44:09] and that they only discovered them in 2014 when they started upgrading

[02:44:13] the systems on these Jets like what is all that

[02:44:16] like what are those things and if you if wanted to slowly

[02:44:21] integrate yourself into the Consciousness much like we're doing with

[02:44:24] well AI is quicker right but it's also a thing that's become

[02:44:28] commonplace we think of it now it's normal chat GPT is

[02:44:32] a normal thing even though it's past the Turing test we're not freaking out you

[02:44:35] have to slowly integrate these sort of things in the human consciousness

[02:44:39] you have to slowly introduce them to the Zeitgeist and

[02:44:43] for it to not be some sort of a complete disruption of society

[02:44:46] where everything shuts down and we just wait for space Daddy to come and rescue

[02:44:50] us it has to become a thing where we slowly

[02:44:54] accept the fact that we are not alone and I would think

[02:44:57] psychologically that would be the very best tactic to play on human beings

[02:45:01] as I know and understand them from being from being one I do not

[02:45:05] think that we would be able to handle just an immediate invasion of

[02:45:09] aliens I think it would break down Society in a way that

[02:45:12] would be catastrophic to everything to all

[02:45:16] businesses to all social ideas Rel religion would fall apart

[02:45:20] everything would be [ __ ] it would be pretty crazy it would be beyond

[02:45:23] crazy it would be Beyond [ __ ] and then alth although

[02:45:27] you could say you could say that's what chat GPT is it could be it's like

[02:45:30] an alien intelligence but I think that's what ultimately they are

[02:45:34] um but I think um

[02:45:38] let me man there there's so many there's so many

[02:45:42] parts of it that uh I find

[02:45:45] puzzling or or disturbing let me let me run one go down one

[02:45:49] other Rabbit Hole along this with you which is

[02:45:53] um you know I always wonder and again this

[02:45:56] is a little bit too simplistic an argument but uh I always

[02:46:00] wonder I'm about to give but what what the

[02:46:04] alien civilization can be like and if you

[02:46:08] have faster than light travel if you have a warp drive

[02:46:11] which is probably what you really need to cover Interstellar

[02:46:16] distances um you know what that means

[02:46:19] for military technology is that you can send weapons

[02:46:23] at warp speed and they will hit you before you see them

[02:46:27] coming and uh there is no defense against a warp

[02:46:30] speed weapon um and you could sort of take

[02:46:34] over the whole universe before anybody could

[02:46:38] see you um could see could see you uh could see you

[02:46:41] um could see you coming and this is by by the way this is sort of a weird

[02:46:45] plot hole in Star wars Star Trek where

[02:46:49] they can travel in hyperspace but then you're you know flying in

[02:46:52] the canyon on so slow you can see the bullets yeah it's

[02:46:56] like it's like at you're and then you're doing this theatrical Klingons

[02:46:59] versus uh Captain Kirk at 10 miles per hour or 20

[02:47:03] miles per hour or whatever right it's funny when you put it that way absurd plot hole

[02:47:07] and um and so um it it

[02:47:11] it tells us that uh I think that if you have

[02:47:15] if you have um faster than light travel

[02:47:19] there's something um really crazy that has to be true

[02:47:23] on a cultural political social level and

[02:47:26] there may be other Solutions but I'll give you my two

[02:47:31] um one of one of them is that

[02:47:34] um you need complete totalitarian

[02:47:39] controls and it is like it

[02:47:43] is the PE the individuals they might

[02:47:47] be might not be perfect they might be demons doesn't matter

[02:47:51] but you have you have a demonic totalitarian

[02:47:55] control of your Society where it's like you have

[02:47:58] you have like Paras psychological mind meld with everybody

[02:48:02] and no one can act independently of anybody else no one can ever

[02:48:06] launch a warp drive weapon and everybody

[02:48:10] who has that ability isn't like a m mind meld

[02:48:14] link with everybody else or or something something like that you can't

[02:48:17] have libertar individualistic free agency

[02:48:21] right and then I think the other the other version

[02:48:25] socially and culturally is

[02:48:29] they have to be like perfectly

[02:48:33] altruistic non- self-interest they have to be angels

[02:48:37] and so the Pula literal thing I'd come to is

[02:48:41] the aliens it's not that they might be demons or

[02:48:44] Angels they must be demons or Angels if you have faster

[02:48:48] than travel and both of those seem

[02:48:52] pretty crazy to me well they're definitely pretty crazy but so are human beings

[02:48:56] um well they're crazy in a very different way yeah but

[02:49:00] not crazy in a different way you compare us to a mouse compare us to

[02:49:03] a mouse and what we're capable of and then from us to them

[02:49:07] not much of a leap and here's my here's my question all but but it is

[02:49:11] it it is a very big leap on a you know if we

[02:49:14] if we say that something like Evolution says that there's

[02:49:18] no such thing as a purely altruistic being

[02:49:21] right if if you were purely altruistic if you only cared about

[02:49:25] other people you don't survive well but why would you necessarily

[02:49:29] think that they'd think that um BEC because uh

[02:49:32] because because then um you beings that are

[02:49:36] not perfectly altruistic are somewhat dangerous

[02:49:39] let me let me and then you and then and then the danger level

[02:49:43] gets correlated to the level of technology and if you have faster than

[02:49:46] light travel it is infinitely dangerous let me address

[02:49:50] that if the probabilities are very low here's my theory I

[02:49:54] think that what human beings are the the Fatal flaw

[02:49:57] that we have is that we're still animals and that we still

[02:50:01] have all these biological limitations and needs this

[02:50:04] is what leads to violence this is what leads to jealousy

[02:50:08] imitation this is what leads to war this what leads to all these things

[02:50:12] as AI becomes more and more powerful we

[02:50:16] will integrate once we integrate with AI if we

[02:50:19] do it like now and then we look at a thousand we scale it

[02:50:23] up exponentially a thousand years from now whatever it's going to be we

[02:50:26] will have no need for any of these biological features

[02:50:31] that have motivated us to get to the point where we're creating AI all

[02:50:34] the things that are wrong in society whether it's inequity

[02:50:38] theft violence pollution all these

[02:50:42] things are essentially poor allocation of resources

[02:50:46] combined with human instinct that are

[02:50:50] ancient we have ancient tribal primate

[02:50:53] instincts and all of these things lead us to believe that this is the only

[02:50:57] way to achieve dominance and control

[02:51:01] allocation of resources the creation of Technology

[02:51:05] new technology eventually reaches a point where it

[02:51:08] becomes far more intelligent than us and we have

[02:51:12] two choices either we integrate or it becomes

[02:51:16] independent and it has no need for us anymore and then that becomes

[02:51:20] a superior life form in the universe and then that life form

[02:51:24] seeks out other life forms to do the same process

[02:51:27] and create it just like it exists and it can travel

[02:51:31] biological life might not be what we're experiencing these things

[02:51:35] might be a form of intelligence that is

[02:51:38] artificial that has progressed to an an infinite point

[02:51:42] where things that are unimaginable us to to us today

[02:51:46] in terms of propulsion and travel and to them it's common place

[02:51:50] and normal I I know that that you're you're trying to be reassuring

[02:51:54] but I I just I find that monologue super non-reassuring

[02:51:57] it's not reassuring there's so many steps in it and every single step

[02:52:01] has to work just the way you describe not necessarily it just has

[02:52:04] to one has to work one sensient artificial intelligence

[02:52:08] that's it and we're on the track to that 100% but it has it it

[02:52:12] it it has it has to it has to be almost

[02:52:15] otherworldly in it's um and it's non- selfishness

[02:52:19] and it's non-h humanness what is selfishness though what is all that

[02:52:23] stuff but all that stuff is attached to us it's all attached to biological limitations

[02:52:27] yeah but it's I I don't I don't think I don't think it's um I don't think it's fundamentally

[02:52:31] about scarcity scarcity is what exists in nature it's

[02:52:34] it's fundamentally about um cultural positional Goods

[02:52:38] within Society it's a scarcity that's created

[02:52:42] culturally are are you familiar with um this um

[02:52:46] '90s spoof movie on Star Trek called Galaxy Quest

[02:52:50] yeah I remember that movie um so this was uh I this is sort of a

[02:52:54] silly PayPal digression story from 1999 um and

[02:52:58] we we had sort of this business model idea we

[02:53:01] had in 99 was we're going to use Palm Pilots to beam money was voted one of the

[02:53:05] 10 worst business ideas of 99 but we uh um we have this sort of

[02:53:09] infrared Port you could um beam people money

[02:53:12] and we had this um idea in around December

[02:53:16] 99 as a media a promotional thing to hire

[02:53:21] um James Doan who played Scotty

[02:53:24] the um in the original Star Trek and he was going to

[02:53:28] do this media promo event for us and it was like an

[02:53:32] 80-some um older Scotty character who's

[02:53:36] horrifically overweight and so it's like this terrible

[02:53:39] spokesperson um and uh but our tagline was you know

[02:53:43] he used to beam people now he's beaming something much more important he's beaming money

[02:53:47] and um and it was this complete flop of media event December

[02:53:51] 99 that uh we did um it was some

[02:53:55] the reporters couldn't get there because the traffic was too bad in San Francisco so

[02:53:58] that you know the tech wasn't working on a much lower tech level but uh

[02:54:03] but anyway we had a bunch of people from our company and there was one point

[02:54:07] where one of them um um

[02:54:11] um and um um William

[02:54:14] Shatner who played um uh James

[02:54:18] Kirk the captain of the original Star Trek he was already doing uh Price

[02:54:22] Line commercials and making a lot of money off of Price Line doing doing commercials

[02:54:26] for them and uh and so one of the people asked James

[02:54:30] Doan the Scotty character what do you think of

[02:54:33] uh William Shatner uh doing commercials for Price

[02:54:37] Line at which point Doan's agent stood

[02:54:40] up and screamed at the top of his voice that is the forbidden

[02:54:44] question that is a forbidden question that is a forbidden question

[02:54:49] and you sort of realized because you know the the con

[02:54:53] the conceit of Star Trek the 60s show

[02:54:57] was that it was a post scarcity World The Transporter

[02:55:01] technology you could you could reconfigure matter into anything you wanted

[02:55:05] uh there was no scarcity there was no need for money the people who wanted

[02:55:09] money were weirdly mentally screwed up people you only need

[02:55:12] money in a world of scarcity you know it's it's it's a post scarcity

[02:55:16] it's sort of a communist world but um but

[02:55:20] uh Galaxy Quest was more correct because it's it's a spoof

[02:55:24] on Star Trek that gets made in the mid 90s where um and

[02:55:27] the Galaxy Quest s discombobulated way I'm telling the story but Galaxy Quest

[02:55:31] is this is this movie where you have these retread Star Trek

[02:55:35] actors and Mr Spock opens a furniture store or something like

[02:55:38] this and they're all like but they all hate hate hate

[02:55:42] the person who played the captain because the captain was a method

[02:55:46] actor where he just lorded it over everyone because even

[02:55:49] in the Communist post scarcity world only one person

[02:55:53] got to be captain and um and so there's a

[02:55:57] great scarcity even in this futuristic sci-fi

[02:56:01] world and that's what we witnessed in 99 because

[02:56:04] that's the way uh William Shatner treated the other actors he was a method

[02:56:08] actor and they hated him and that was uh

[02:56:12] and uh and so um even in the Star Trek world the

[02:56:16] humans you know obviously they were just they were stuck in the 1960s

[02:56:20] mentally that's what you'll say but uh but um I don't

[02:56:23] I don't think it's that straightforward for us to evolve they're humans I don't think

[02:56:27] we're going to be humans anymore but uh I think artificial

[02:56:30] life but then but then I hear that is we're going to be extinct yes

[02:56:35] I don't like that I don't like it either but I think logically

[02:56:38] that's what's going to happen I think if you look at this

[02:56:43] mad rush for artificial intelligence like they're they're literally building

[02:56:46] nuclear reactors to power AI right

[02:56:50] well they're talking about it yeah okay that's because they

[02:56:53] know they're going to need enormous amounts of power to do the once they have that and once that's online

[02:56:57] once it keeps getting better and better and better where does that go that

[02:57:01] goes to some sort of an artificial life form and I think either

[02:57:05] we become that thing or we integrate

[02:57:08] with that thing and become cyborgs or that thing takes over and

[02:57:12] that thing becomes the primary life force of the universe and I think that

[02:57:15] biological life we look at like life because we

[02:57:19] know what life is but I think it's very possible the Digital Life

[02:57:23] or created Life by people is just as not

[02:57:26] just it might be a superior life form far superior

[02:57:30] if we looked at US versus chimp Nation right

[02:57:34] I don't want to live in the jungle and fight with other chimps

[02:57:37] and just rely on berries and eating monkeys that's crazy

[02:57:41] I want to live like a person I want to be able to go to a restaurant why because

[02:57:45] human life has advanced far beyond Prime life

[02:57:49] we are stuck in thinking that this is the only way to live

[02:57:53] because it's the way we live I love music I love comedy

[02:57:56] I love art I love the things that people create I love

[02:58:00] people that make great clothes and cars and businesses I love

[02:58:04] people I think people are awesome I'm a fan of people

[02:58:08] but if I had to look logically I would I would assume

[02:58:11] that we are on the way out and that the only way forward

[02:58:15] really to make an enormous leap in terms

[02:58:19] of the integration of society and of

[02:58:23] technology and of our understanding our place in the universe is for

[02:58:26] us to transcend our physical limitations that are essentially based

[02:58:30] on primate biology and these primate desires

[02:58:34] for status like being the captain or for

[02:58:37] control of resources of all these things we assume these things are

[02:58:41] standard and that they have to exist in intelligent species I

[02:58:45] think they only have to exist in intelligent species that have biological

[02:58:49] limitations I think intelligent species can be something and is

[02:58:53] going to be something that is created by people and that might

[02:58:56] be what happens everywhere in the universe that

[02:59:00] might be the exact course where there's a limit to biological

[02:59:04] evolution it's painstaking natural selection it's it's time

[02:59:07] consuming or you get that thing

[02:59:11] to create the other form of life

[02:59:15] man I um let me you know I

[02:59:23] keep I keep thinking there are two alternate histories

[02:59:27] that are alternate stories of the future that are more plausible

[02:59:31] than the one you just told and um so one of them

[02:59:34] is it sounds like yours but it's just the Silicon Valley

[02:59:38] propaganda story where where they say that's what they're going to

[02:59:42] do and then of course they don't quite do it

[02:59:46] and it doesn't quite work and um it goes It goes

[02:59:49] super super haywire and um

[02:59:53] and that's uh and that's where okay yeah there's a one% chance

[02:59:56] that works and um there's a 99%

[03:00:00] chance that um that ends up so you have two

[03:00:04] choices you have a company that does exactly what you do

[03:00:08] and that's super ethical super restrained does everything right and

[03:00:11] there's a company that says all the things you just said but then

[03:00:15] Cuts corners and doesn't quite do it and I won't say it's

[03:00:19] 1 to 99 but that that sounds more plausible as

[03:00:23] that it ends up being corporate propaganda and then

[03:00:27] um you know my prior would be even more likely this

[03:00:30] of course the argument the effective altruist the anti- AI people make is

[03:00:34] yeah Joe you're um the story you're telling us that's just going to be the fake corporate

[03:00:38] propaganda and um and we need to push back on that

[03:00:42] and um and the way you push back is you need to regulate

[03:00:46] it and you need to govern it and you need to do

[03:00:49] it globally um and this is you know um

[03:00:53] the Rand Corporation in Southern California uh

[03:00:56] has you know one one of their verticals and it's a sort of public private

[03:01:01] Fusion but one of the things they they they're pushing for is something they call

[03:01:04] Global compute governance which is um

[03:01:08] yeah it's uh the AI the the the accelerationist

[03:01:12] AI story is too scary and too dangerous and

[03:01:15] too likely to go wrong and so um you know

[03:01:19] we need to have uh you know Global governance which

[03:01:22] from my point of view sounds even worse but so

[03:01:26] utopian but that's that's uh that's I think

[03:01:30] I think that's the story that's the story uh the

[03:01:33] problem with that story is China is not going to go along with that program they're

[03:01:37] going to keep going full steam ahead and we're going to have to go keep going full steam

[03:01:40] ahead in order to compete with China there's no way you're going to be able to

[03:01:44] regulate It in America and compete with people that are not regulating

[03:01:48] worldwide and then once it becomes sentient once you have

[03:01:51] an artificial intelligent creature that has been created by human

[03:01:55] beings it can make better versions of itself over and over and over again

[03:01:58] and keep doing it it's going to get to a point where it's far superior

[03:02:02] to anything that we can imagine well well to the to the extent it's driven by

[03:02:06] the military and other competition with China um

[03:02:10] you know that's until it becomes sensient that that that that suggests it's going to

[03:02:13] be even less in in the sort of um

[03:02:17] you know utopian altruistic uh dire

[03:02:21] it's going be even more dangerous right unless it gets away from them this is

[03:02:24] my thought if it gets away from them and it has no motivation to listen

[03:02:28] to anything that human beings have told it if it's completely immune

[03:02:31] to programming which totally makes sense that it would be it

[03:02:35] totally makes sense that if it's going to make better versions of itself the first thing it's going to do is eliminate

[03:02:38] human influence especially when these humans are corrupt it's going to go I'm not going to let these

[03:02:42] people tell me what to do and what to control and they would have no no reason

[03:02:46] to do that no reason listen I I sort of generally

[03:02:49] don't think we should trust China or the CCP

[03:02:54] but but the you know probably

[03:02:58] the count the best counter argument they would have is that

[03:03:01] they are interested in maintaining control and they are crazy

[03:03:06] fanatical about that and that's why

[03:03:10] um you know the CCP might actually regulate it and they're

[03:03:13] going to put they're going to they're going to put breaks

[03:03:17] on this in a way that uh that we might not in in

[03:03:20] in Silicon Valley and and it's it's it's it's a it's a

[03:03:24] technology they understand that will undermine their power that's

[03:03:28] an interesting perspective and then they would be anti comp I don't

[03:03:31] fully believe them but right I I know what you're saying it's

[03:03:35] it's it's sort of uh there there's sort of

[03:03:38] a weird way um

[03:03:42] all the big tech companies it seemed to me where

[03:03:46] natural ways for the CCP to extend its power to control

[03:03:50] the population 10cent Alibaba and then

[03:03:53] um and then because it was it was you know but then it's also

[03:03:57] in theory the tech is can be used as an alternate channel

[03:04:01] for people to organize or or or or things like this

[03:04:05] and uh even though it's 80% control and maybe

[03:04:09] 20% risk of loss of control um

[03:04:12] maybe that 20% was too high and there's sort of

[03:04:16] a strange way over the last seven eight years where you know Jack

[03:04:19] M Alibaba all these people sort of got uh got

[03:04:23] shoved aside for uh these party functionaries that are effectively

[03:04:27] running these companies so there there is something about um the

[03:04:31] the big Tech story in China where uh the people running these

[03:04:34] companies were seen as national champions a decade ago now they're

[03:04:38] the enemies of the people and uh it's sort of

[03:04:42] the Lite thing was this uh you

[03:04:46] know this the CCP has full control you have this

[03:04:50] new technology that would give you even more control but there's a chance you lose it

[03:04:54] how how do you think about that very good point and then that's what they've done with consumer

[03:04:58] internet and then there's probably something about the AI

[03:05:02] where M it's possible they're they're not even in

[03:05:05] the running and that c certainly um and certainly it feels

[03:05:09] like it's it's all happening you know in in

[03:05:13] the US and so may maybe

[03:05:16] it is you know maybe it could still be

[03:05:20] maybe it could still be be stopped and then well that is a problem with Espionage

[03:05:24] right so even if it's happening in the USU they're going to take that information they're going to

[03:05:27] figure out how to get it you you can get it but then you know if

[03:05:31] if you if you build it is there you still have the same core problem

[03:05:35] some air gap does it you know does it jump the air gap does it somehow

[03:05:39] that's a good point that they would be so concerned about control that they wouldn't allow it to get to the

[03:05:43] point where it gets there and we would get there first and then it would be controlled by Silicone Valley

[03:05:49] or spiral out of control but then I

[03:05:53] I think I think my and again this is very very speculative

[03:05:57] conversation but my um my read on

[03:06:00] the I don't know cultural social Vibe

[03:06:04] is that uh um the scary

[03:06:08] dystopian AI narrative is way more compelling

[03:06:12] you know the I don't like the effective altruist people I don't like the

[03:06:15] Lites but man I think are this time around they are winning

[03:06:19] the arguments and um and so

[03:06:23] you know my I don't know you know it's it's mixing

[03:06:27] metaphors but do you want to be worried about Doctor Strange

[03:06:31] Love who wants to blow up the world to build bigger bombs

[03:06:35] or do you want to worry about Greta who wants to you know

[03:06:39] make everyone drive a bicycle so the world doesn't get destroyed and

[03:06:42] um we're in a world where people are worried about Doctor Strange Love

[03:06:46] they're not worried about Gret and it's the Greta equivalent

[03:06:50] in um in AI that that uh my model is is

[03:06:54] is going to be surprisingly powerful

[03:06:58] it's going to be outlawed it's going to be regulated as we have outlawed

[03:07:02] you know so many other vectors of innovation I mean you can think about

[03:07:06] why was there progress in computers over the last 50 years and not

[03:07:09] other stuff because the computers were mostly inert

[03:07:13] it was mostly this virtual reality that was air gapped from The Real

[03:07:17] World it was you know yeah it's it's um what you know

[03:07:20] yeah there's all this crazy stuff that happens on the internet

[03:07:24] but most of the time what happens on the internet stays on the Internet it's it's it's

[03:07:28] actually pretty it's it's it's it's pretty decoupled

[03:07:32] and then um and that's why we've

[03:07:35] had a relatively light regulatory touch

[03:07:39] on on that stuff vers versus so many other things and then

[03:07:43] you know um but there there's no reason you know if

[03:07:47] if uh if you had you know I don't

[03:07:51] know if you had the FDA regulating video games

[03:07:54] or regulating AI I I think the progress would slow

[03:07:58] down a lot 100% that would be a [ __ ] disaster

[03:08:02] yeah yeah that would be a disaster but but again it's you know they get to Reg

[03:08:06] you know yeah Pharmaceuticals are they're not doing a job with

[03:08:09] that either I know I know but uh but they you know

[03:08:13] theide or whatever you know all all these things that went really Haywire

[03:08:17] did a good job at people are scared yeah they're not scared of video

[03:08:21] games they're scared of you know dangerous Pharmaceuticals and if

[03:08:25] if um if you if you think of AI as it's not just a video

[03:08:28] game it's about not just about this world of bits but it's going to air gap and it's

[03:08:32] going to affect you your physical world in a real

[03:08:36] way um you know maybe um

[03:08:40] maybe you uh cross the air gap and get the FDA or some other the problem

[03:08:43] is they're not good at regulating anything there's no

[03:08:47] govern agency that you said that you can see that does a stellar

[03:08:51] job I I don't I I I think it's but but I I think they have been

[03:08:54] pretty good at slowing things down and stopping them and right

[03:08:58] you know we've we've made a lot less progress on

[03:09:02] I don't know ex extending human life we've made no progress on curing

[03:09:06] Dementia in 40 or 50 years there's all the stuff where

[03:09:10] um you know it's been regulated to death which I think is

[03:09:14] is very bad from the point of view of progress but uh

[03:09:17] it is it is pretty effective as a regulation they've stopped stuff

[03:09:22] they they've been effectively Lite they've been very effective at being Lites

[03:09:26] interesting well I I I'm really considering

[03:09:30] your perspective on China and AI it's very but but I again

[03:09:33] these these stories are all like very speculative and like like maybe

[03:09:37] you you can the counter argument in mind be something like that's what China

[03:09:40] thinks it will be doing but um it will somehow

[03:09:44] you know um goog go Rogue on them yeah

[03:09:48] or they're too arrogant about how much power they think the CCP has and

[03:09:51] it will go Rogue or so there are sort of I'm not not at all

[03:09:55] sure this is this is right but I think I think the

[03:09:59] man I I think the US the US

[03:10:03] one I would say is that

[03:10:07] uh um I think

[03:10:10] the pro aai people in Silicon Valley are doing a

[03:10:14] pretty bad job on

[03:10:18] let's say convincing people that it's

[03:10:22] going to be good for them that it's going to be good for the average person it's going to be good for our

[03:10:25] society and um and if if it if it all ends

[03:10:29] up being and if it all ends up being some

[03:10:33] version you know um humans are headed towards the glue factory like

[03:10:36] a horse um man that's uh

[03:10:41] that that sort of probably makes me want to become a lite

[03:10:44] too well it sucks for us if it's true but

[03:10:48] if that's if that's if that's that's the most positive story you can tell

[03:10:52] then my my I I I don't think that necessarily means we're going to go to the glue

[03:10:56] factory I think it means you know the glue factory is getting shut

[03:11:00] down maybe I don't know if who [ __ ] runs the

[03:11:03] glue factory that's the problem I I don't know

[03:11:07] I'm just speculating too but I'm trying to be objective when I

[03:11:10] speculate and I just don't think that this is going to last I

[03:11:14] don't think that our position as the AP X Predator

[03:11:18] number one animal on the planet is going to last I think we're going to create something

[03:11:21] that surpasses us and I think that's probably what happens

[03:11:25] and that's probably what these things are that visit us I think that's what they are

[03:11:28] I don't I don't think they're biological I think they're probably what comes after

[03:11:32] a society develops the kind of technology that we're currently in

[03:11:36] the middle of

[03:11:40] and man the the the the the part that

[03:11:43] look there all these there all these places where

[03:11:48] um there are parts of the story we don't know right

[03:11:52] and so it's like how did

[03:11:55] my my my my general thesis is there is no evolutionary

[03:11:59] path to this maybe there's a guided outside

[03:12:03] alien super intelligence path for us to become

[03:12:07] superum and fundamentally benevolent and fundamentally

[03:12:11] uh radically different beings but um there's no

[03:12:15] natural evolutionary path for this to happen and

[03:12:18] then I don't know how this would have happened for the alien civilization

[03:12:22] presumably there was some but isn't that evolutionary path the invention

[03:12:26] of superior technology that's a new form of life no but but but but

[03:12:30] but the the story you're telling was it can't we can't just leave the humans

[03:12:34] to the Natural Evolution because we're still like animals we're still into

[03:12:38] status all these crazy but those are the things that

[03:12:41] motivate us to innovate um and and if we keep innovating

[03:12:45] at some point we will destroy ourselves

[03:12:49] that no no but your your the story telling earlier was

[03:12:53] you need you need to have directed in

[03:12:57] evolution it's like intelligent design it's something it's like there's some

[03:13:00] Godlike being that's actually has to take over from

[03:13:04] Evolution and guide our cultural and political

[03:13:08] and biological development no might not have any use

[03:13:12] for us at all it might just ignore us and let us live like The Chimps do

[03:13:15] and then become the superior for force in the planet

[03:13:19] um it doesn't have to get rid of us it doesn't have to send us to the glue factory

[03:13:23] it can let us exist just like put boundaries on I I thought it has to

[03:13:27] but it has to stop us from developing this well what if we just end

[03:13:30] here and we stay Being Human and we can continue

[03:13:34] with biological evolution as long as that takes but this new life

[03:13:38] form now becomes a superior life form on Earth and we

[03:13:41] still you know we could still have sex we could still have kids but by the way that's

[03:13:45] going down our ability to have children is decreasing because of

[03:13:49] our use of technology which is wild right our use of plastics and

[03:13:52] microplastics is causing thades to enter into people's systems it's changing

[03:13:57] the development pattern of children to the point it's measurable

[03:14:01] there's a lot of research that shows that the chemicals and the

[03:14:05] environmental factors that we are all experiencing on a

[03:14:08] daily basis are radically lowering birth rates

[03:14:12] radically lowering the ability that men

[03:14:15] have to develop sperm and more miscarriages all these things are connected

[03:14:19] to the chemicals in our environment which is directly connected to our use of Technology

[03:14:23] it's almost like these things coincide naturally and

[03:14:27] they work naturally to the point where we become this sort of feminized

[03:14:31] thing that creates this technology that surpasses

[03:14:34] us and then we just exist for as long as we do

[03:14:39] as biological things but now there's a new thing

[03:14:43] yeah that's um crazy idea might not be real it's just

[03:14:47] a theory but we seem to be moving

[03:14:50] in a direction of becoming less and less like

[03:14:54] animals um yeah I think I think there still are

[03:14:58] we still have a pretty crazy geopolitical race with China to come

[03:15:01] back to that sure you know um the natural development

[03:15:05] of drone technology in the military context is you need to take the

[03:15:09] human out of the loop because the human can get jammed sure

[03:15:12] and so you need to put an AI on the drones well they're using AI for dog fights

[03:15:16] and they're 100% effective against human pilots and so um

[03:15:20] there sort of are and all these things you know there's

[03:15:23] there's a logic to them but um

[03:15:27] there doesn't seem to be a good end game no the end game doesn't look

[03:15:31] good but it's going to be interesting Peter it's definitely going to be interesting

[03:15:34] it's interesting right now right um

[03:15:38] man I do you do you think

[03:15:42] the I think all these things are very overdetermined do you think that

[03:15:46] the collap in birth rates you know

[03:15:50] it yeah it could be Plastics but isn't it just

[03:15:53] isn't it just a feature of late modernity there's that as well there's

[03:15:57] there's a feature of um women having careers

[03:16:00] right so they want to postpone child sure that's a factor um

[03:16:04] there's a factor of men being so engrossed in their career

[03:16:08] that their testosterone declines lack of sleep stress cortisol

[03:16:12] levels alcohol consumption a lot of different things that

[03:16:15] are factors in uh declining sperm rate

[03:16:19] sperm count in men you have miscarriage rates that are up

[03:16:23] you have a lot of pharmaceutical drugs you get attached to that as well

[03:16:26] that have to do with low birth weight or birth rates rather

[03:16:30] there's a lot of factors but those factors all seem to be connected

[03:16:34] to society and our our civilization and

[03:16:37] technology in general because the environmental factors all

[03:16:41] have to do with technology all of them have to do with inventions and

[03:16:45] these unnatural factors that are entering into the biological body of

[03:16:48] human beings and causing these changes and none of these changes are good

[03:16:52] in terms of us being able to reproduce and if you factor

[03:16:56] in the fact that these changes didn't exist 50 years ago I mean 40 years

[03:16:59] ago we didn't even have Alzheimer's right so yeah people

[03:17:03] didn't get that old no they got that old they got that old the Alzheimer's

[03:17:07] has to do with the the the myelin in the human brain

[03:17:11] it has to do with the fact that myelin is made entirely of cholesterol

[03:17:15] the the primary Theory they think now is lack of cholesterol in the diet might

[03:17:18] be leading to some of these factors you have also environmental

[03:17:22] things there's like we're getting poisoned on a daily basis our diets are [ __ ]

[03:17:26] terrible the things that human being like what percentage of us are obese

[03:17:29] it's drink but yeah Diet Coke's great though a few every day

[03:17:34] you'll be fine I'm not worried about Diet Coke I'm I'm worried about a

[03:17:37] lot of things though I'm I'm worried about I think there's a natural

[03:17:42] progression that's happening and I think it coincides

[03:17:46] with the invention of of technology and that it just seems to me to be too

[03:17:49] coincidental that we don't notice it that the invention of Technology

[03:17:53] also leads to the the

[03:17:57] the disruption of the sexual reproduction systems of human beings

[03:18:01] like boy doesn't that and then if you get to a point

[03:18:04] where human beings can no longer reproduce sexually which

[03:18:08] you could see that P if if we've dropped like human

[03:18:12] men's male sperm count has dropped something something crazy from

[03:18:15] the 1950s to today and continues to do so for the average male

[03:18:19] and if you just Just Jack that up to a thousand years from now you could get

[03:18:23] to a point where there's no longer natural child birth and that people are all

[03:18:26] having birth through test tubes and some sort of new invention

[03:18:30] I'm I'm always I'm always um

[03:18:34] let me think uh I think the why

[03:18:37] why have birth rates collapsed is it's probably

[03:18:42] uh it's again an overdetermined story it's the

[03:18:45] plastics it's the screens it's the um

[03:18:50] you know it's uh it's certain

[03:18:53] um you know ways they're not comp children are not compatible

[03:18:58] with um having a career in late modernity

[03:19:01] um probably our economics of it where people can't afford houses

[03:19:05] or space um um

[03:19:09] but I'm I'm probably always a little bit more anchored

[03:19:13] on um the social and cultural

[03:19:17] dimensions of this stuff and uh and again the imitation

[03:19:21] version of this is um you know

[03:19:24] and it's sort of conserved across you know it's people are below the replacement

[03:19:28] rate in all 50 states of the US even Mormon Utah

[03:19:32] the average woman has less than two kids um it's

[03:19:36] um Iran is below that Italy way below it South Korea

[03:19:39] Jaan inal it's all these like it's all these very different types

[03:19:43] of societies and so the fact that it's so and then you know Israel

[03:19:47] is still sort of a weird exception um and

[03:19:51] and then if you ask you know um

[03:19:54] my my sort of simplistic somewhat circular

[03:19:58] explanation would be um you know people

[03:20:02] have kids if other people have kids and they stop having kids

[03:20:06] when other people stop having kids and so there's there's some there's

[03:20:09] a dimension of it that's just you know if you're if you're a

[03:20:13] 27y old woman in Israel you better

[03:20:16] get married and you have to keep up with your other friends that are having kids

[03:20:21] and um and that's and if you don't you're just like

[03:20:24] a weirdo who doesn't fit into society or something like that no there's certainly a

[03:20:28] cultural aspect of and then if you're in South Korea where I think the total

[03:20:32] fertility rates like 0.7 it's like onethird of the replacement

[03:20:35] rate like every generation's going down by 2/3 or

[03:20:39] something like this right really F heading towards Extinction pretty pretty

[03:20:43] fast um um it is something like

[03:20:47] probably none of your friends are doing it and and then

[03:20:51] and then you're you're you're you're uh you're in this and then and then probably

[03:20:55] there are ways it it it shifts the uh the politics in a very

[03:20:59] very deep way where um you know once you get an inverted

[03:21:03] demographic pyramid where you have way more old people

[03:21:07] than young people um at some point you

[03:21:10] know there's always a question do you vote you know do do you vote for benefits

[03:21:14] for the old or for the very young do you do you spend money

[03:21:18] so Johnny can read or so Grandma can have a spare

[03:21:22] leg and um and once

[03:21:25] you know once the demographic flips and you get this inverted pyramid

[03:21:29] maybe the the politics shifts in a very deep way where

[03:21:33] um the people with kids get penalized more and more economically

[03:21:37] it just costs more and more and uh and then the old people

[03:21:40] without kids just vote more and more benefits for themselves

[03:21:44] effectively and then it it just sort of um

[03:21:48] you know it's once it flips it may be very hard to reverse

[03:21:52] I looked at all these sort of heterodox uh demographers

[03:21:55] but I'm blanking on the name but there sort of the set of um where you know it's

[03:21:59] like what are long-term demographic projections and there's this uh

[03:22:03] you know if if you know there are 8 billion people on the planet

[03:22:07] and you know if every woman has

[03:22:11] not two babies but one baby then every generation's half

[03:22:15] the previous and next generation's 4 billion M

[03:22:19] and then and then people think well it's it's just going to

[03:22:22] it'll eventually you'll have women who want more kids and it'll just

[03:22:26] get a smaller population then it will bounce back

[03:22:30] um uh yeah one of the Japanese demographers I

[03:22:34] uh was looking at on this um a few years ago

[03:22:38] his thesis was no once it flips it doesn't flip

[03:22:41] back because you've changed all the politics to where people get dis incented

[03:22:45] and so and then you should just extrapolate this as the permanent

[03:22:49] birth rate and if it's if it's one on average of one baby

[03:22:53] per woman um and you have a having

[03:22:57] and then it's in 33 Generations 2 to the 33rd

[03:23:01] is about 8 billion um and if every generation's 30 years

[03:23:05] 30 time 33 is 990 years in 990 years

[03:23:09] you'd predict there'd be one person left on the planet Jesus Christ

[03:23:12] and um and then then we'd go extinct if there's only one person left

[03:23:16] that doesn't work and um and again that's

[03:23:20] it's a very long-term extrapolation but the claim is

[03:23:24] that just you know once you once you flip it um

[03:23:28] it it it kicks in all these social

[03:23:31] and political Dimensions that are then like yeah maybe it

[03:23:35] got flipped by the screens or the Plastics or

[03:23:39] you know the drugs or other other stuff but once it's flipped you

[03:23:42] you change the whole society and it actually stays

[03:23:46] flipped and it's very very hard to undo that makes sense and it's more

[03:23:50] terrifying than my idea but then you know always the

[03:23:53] but then you know the the you know the weird you know the weird history on

[03:23:57] this was you know it was 50 years

[03:24:01] ago or whatever 1968 Paul Erick writes the population

[03:24:04] bomb and it's just the population is just going to exponentially

[03:24:08] grow and um yeah in theory you can have exponential

[03:24:12] growth where it doubles you can have exponential decay

[03:24:16] where it haves every generation and then in theory there's

[03:24:20] some stable equilibrium where you know it's you know

[03:24:23] everybody has exactly two kids and it's completely stable

[03:24:27] but it turns out that that solution is is very

[03:24:31] very hard to get calibrate and you either yeah and we shifted

[03:24:35] from exponential growth to exponential decay and it's

[03:24:38] probably going to be quite Herculean to get back to

[03:24:42] something like stasis well let's end this on a happy note

[03:24:46] I don't know no it's yeah

[03:24:50] that's a terrifying thought and maybe true and maybe what happens

[03:24:54] but we don't know you know we haven't gone through it before

[03:24:57] um but there I think there's a lot of factors like you're saying I think that one's very compelling

[03:25:01] and it's scary especially the South Korea thing that's

[03:25:06] nuts yeah it's always it's always sort of

[03:25:10] idiosyncratic there's always things that are idiosyncratic

[03:25:14] to the society so it's you know it's it's you know it's it's extremely

[03:25:18] polarized on the gender on the gender

[03:25:22] thing and you know um if you get married with

[03:25:25] kids you're you're you're pushed into this super traditional

[03:25:29] structure the women don't want to be in that structure

[03:25:33] they opt out and then um and so there are sort of

[03:25:36] idiosyncratic things you can say about East Asia and confusion societies

[03:25:41] and the way they're not interacting well with modernity but then

[03:25:45] you know there's there's a part of it where I wonder with it's just it's just

[03:25:48] an extreme you know extreme version of it and then

[03:25:52] I don't know you know my my some my somewhat fastfall answer is always you know

[03:25:56] on this stuff is I don't know what to do about these things but my fastfall answer is always

[03:26:00] the first step is to talk about them and if you can't even talk about them

[03:26:04] we're never going to solve them and then maybe that's only the small First Step

[03:26:08] but that's that's always sort of my my my fast L I was in I was in South

[03:26:12] Korea a year and a half ago two two years ago now and

[03:26:16] um uh I met um you

[03:26:19] know one of the CEOs who ran one of the CH ball one of the Giant

[03:26:23] conglomerates and I I I I sort of thought this would

[03:26:27] be a interesting topic to talk about and

[03:26:30] uh and then you know it's probably probably all sorts of cultural things I was

[03:26:34] offending or you you're saying obviously this what are you going to do about this

[03:26:38] catastrophic birth rate is my opening question and uh

[03:26:42] and then um the way uh you know

[03:26:46] the way way he dealt with it

[03:26:49] was um just turned to me and said uh you're

[03:26:53] totally right it's a total disaster and then as soon as you

[03:26:56] acknowledge it he felt you didn't need to talk about it anymore and we could move on wow

[03:27:00] so we have to try to do a little bit better than

[03:27:05] that wow

[03:27:09] because you know I I I I think I think there it is always this

[03:27:13] strange thing where there's so many of these things where we

[03:27:18] can you know where somehow talking about

[03:27:22] things is the first step but then it also becomes the excuse

[03:27:26] for for not doing not doing more not

[03:27:30] not really solving them um you know there's all

[03:27:33] this probably are all these dietary things

[03:27:37] where you sort of know what you're supposed to do and then if you know

[03:27:41] what you're supposed to do maybe that's that's good enough and you can still have

[03:27:45] one piece of chocolate before you go on the diet tomorrow or whatever

[03:27:48] and uh and so it sort of becomes this you know and so

[03:27:53] somehow um figur out a way

[03:27:56] to turn this knowledge into something actionable is always always a

[03:28:00] thing that's that's tricky it's it's it's it's it's sort of where I always find myself

[03:28:03] very skeptical of um

[03:28:07] of you know yeah all these modalities of

[03:28:11] therapy where um you know the theory is that uh

[03:28:15] um you figure out people's problems

[03:28:19] and by figuring them out you change them and then

[03:28:23] and then it and then ideally it becomes you know

[03:28:28] an activator for change and then in practice

[03:28:31] it often becomes the opposite the way it works is something like this it's like you know

[03:28:35] um Psychotherapy gets it gets advertised as self-

[03:28:40] transformation and um and then after you spend years in therapy

[03:28:43] and you maybe you learn a lot of interesting things about s you sort of

[03:28:47] get exhausted from talking to the therapist and um

[03:28:51] at some point it crashes out from self- transformation

[03:28:55] into self-acceptance and you realize one day no you're actually

[03:28:59] just perfect the way you are

[03:29:02] and and so it's you know there there these things

[03:29:06] that that may be very powerful on the level of of insight

[03:29:10] and telling us things about ourselves but then you

[03:29:14] know do they actually get us to change

[03:29:17] well that is an interesting thing about talking about things because I think you're correct that

[03:29:21] when you talk about things often times this it is a sub

[03:29:25] you you are at least in some

[03:29:29] way avoiding doing those things it's a question yeah

[03:29:32] in some ways it's a substitute but also you have to talk about

[03:29:36] them to understand that you need to do something yeah that's always my excuse I acknowledge

[03:29:40] but you have to do that and I also realize that it's often my cop out answer

[03:29:43] too it could be both things right the problem is taking action and what what

[03:29:47] action to take and you know the paralysis by analysis where

[03:29:51] you're just like trying to figure out what to do and how to do it yeah yeah

[03:29:54] but I think talking about it is the most important thing strategy is often a euphemism

[03:29:58] for procrastination yes it is something like that there's a lot of that

[03:30:02] going on it's very hard for people to just take steps they they but

[03:30:05] they talk about it a lot yeah listen man I really

[03:30:09] enjoyed talking to you aw it was really fun it was great great conversation

[03:30:12] a lot of great insight and a lot of things that I'm going to think about a lot thank you very
