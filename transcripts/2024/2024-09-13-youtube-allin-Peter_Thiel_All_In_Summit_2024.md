[Peter Thiel | All-In Summit 2024](https://youtu.be/SYRunzR9fbk)

[00:00:00] Peter was the person who told me this really pithy

[00:00:05] quote in a world that's changing so quickly the

[00:00:08] biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk

[00:00:12] this guy is a tough nut to try to sort of explain

[00:00:16] changed money with PayPal was the first outside investor in Facebook

[00:00:20] uh back paler which is I believe they helped find Osama Bin Laden

[00:00:24] almost certainly the most successful technology investor in the

[00:00:28] world I don't think the future is fixed I think what matters

[00:00:32] is a question of agency what I think works really well

[00:00:36] are sort of oneof A- kind companies how do you get from

[00:00:39] Z to one what great business is nobody building tell me something that's true

[00:00:43] that nobody agrees with you on all right Peter

[00:00:47] welcome back it's good to see [Applause]

[00:00:51] you um you don't do this too

[00:00:55] often uh so we do appreciate it U but when you do do it you're always

[00:00:58] super candid and appreciate that as well you fit right in here um

[00:01:02] you're sitting this year's political cycle out

[00:01:07] right politics well no I mean I think this is a question we all

[00:01:10] have which is you were very active um you bet on Jed

[00:01:14] in a major way um he delivered today it was a very impressive

[00:01:18] uh discussion why aren't you involved this this cycle

[00:01:22] where it's very confounding to us because these are your guys man how much time do we

[00:01:26] have supposed talk about this for two hours or something um

[00:01:30] um I I don't know look I have a lot of conflicted thoughts

[00:01:34] on it uh I I am still very

[00:01:38] strongly prot Trump Pro uh Pro JD I've decided

[00:01:41] not to uh donate any money politically but uh

[00:01:45] I'm supporting them in every other way uh every other way

[00:01:49] possible uh I you know uh obviously

[00:01:53] uh you know I think uh I think

[00:01:57] there's my my pessimistic thought is that uh

[00:02:00] Trump is is going to win and probably will win by a big

[00:02:04] margin uh he'll do better than the last time and it'll

[00:02:08] still be really disappointing because you know the elections are always a relative

[00:02:12] Choice and then once someone's president it's an absolute

[00:02:15] and they you get evaluated you know do you like Trump or Harris

[00:02:19] better and that seems there seem to be a lot of reasons you know and

[00:02:23] that one would be more anti-h haris than anti-trump let's again

[00:02:26] no one's Pro any of these people it's all it's all negative right um

[00:02:30] and uh but then after after they win there will be a lot of buyers

[00:02:34] remorse and disappointment that's sort of that's sort of the arc that I I see

[00:02:38] of what's going to happen and it's it's somewhat under motivating um

[00:02:41] I don't know just to describe describe it I I think you know

[00:02:45] I think it's I think the odds are slightly in favor of trump but it's basically

[00:02:49] 5050 um my one contrarian view on the election is that it's

[00:02:52] not going to be close un you know most presidential elections aren't

[00:02:56] and uh you know one side just breaks you know 20 2016 2020

[00:03:00] we super close but two-thirds of the elections aren't and you know you can't

[00:03:03] always line things up and figure it out I think either the you know the comma

[00:03:07] bubble will burst or you know maybe maybe the Trump voters get really

[00:03:11] demotivated and don't show up but I think you know one side is is simply going to

[00:03:14] collapse in the next uh in the next two months and then you know

[00:03:18] if you want to get involved you know with all the headaches that come with being involved

[00:03:22] if it makes a difference counterfactually and if it's a really close election everything

[00:03:26] makes a difference if it's if it's not even close I don't think it makes much of

[00:03:29] a difference if if it is going to be close by the way if it's if it's like going to be

[00:03:33] a razor thin close election then um then I'm pretty sure KLA

[00:03:36] will win because um because they will cheat they will fortify it

[00:03:40] they will steal the ballots and so so uh so you know

[00:03:44] if we if we can if we can if we can and so

[00:03:47] then in the event in the event that it's close I don't want to be involved

[00:03:51] in the event that it's not close I don't need to be involved and so

[00:03:55] that's sort of that's sort of a straightforward analis right there jumping off

[00:03:58] point much cheating on a percentage basis do you

[00:04:02] think happens every year how much and do you think Trump

[00:04:06] actually careful with the verb so you know um cheating

[00:04:10] stealing that implies something happened the dark night

[00:04:14] I think the verb you're allowed to use is fortify okay yeah we don't want get canell

[00:04:18] on YouTube ballot harvesting I mean it was you know it's all sort of

[00:04:21] there were all these rule changes it was sort of done in plain daylight and

[00:04:25] uh um but yeah I think I think our elections are not they're not

[00:04:29] perfectly clean otherwise we could examine it we could have vigorous

[00:04:33] debate about it well what would you change then what what should change cuz we all want

[00:04:36] everybody's votes to count we want it to be clean um

[00:04:40] I'm I'm talking about the audience here I know at a minimum you you'd run them

[00:04:44] you'd try to run elections the same way you do it in every other Western democracy

[00:04:47] you have one day voting you have practically no absentee ballots

[00:04:52] um you have um and um and

[00:04:55] it's you know it's it's it's it's it's one day where everything happens

[00:04:59] it's not this uh two two-month elongated process

[00:05:03] that's what the way you do it in every other country you you'd have you'd have some somewhat

[00:05:07] stronger voter ID and you know make sure

[00:05:10] that you know the people who are voting have a right to vote um make it a

[00:05:14] national holiday that's that's basically that's basically what you do in every other

[00:05:17] Western democracy and it's it's it and it used to be much more like that in

[00:05:21] the US I mean it's it's it's meaningfully decayed over the last 20 30 years

[00:05:25] you 20 30 years ago 30 40 years ago you you got the results on the

[00:05:29] day of of the vote and that sort of stopped happening a while ago

[00:05:33] what would make you not disappointed so Trump gets

[00:05:36] elected how do you what's your counternarrative on

[00:05:40] you know where a year or two years past the election Trump

[00:05:44] is president what what makes you say I'm surprisingly not

[00:05:47] disappointed what takes place man it's

[00:05:52] um you know it's I I I think there are some extremely

[00:05:56] difficult problems that it's it's it's really hard to know how

[00:05:59] how to how how to solve them I wouldn't know what to do but

[00:06:03] uh we have you know we have an incre incredibly big deficit

[00:06:07] and uh and yeah if you can if you can

[00:06:10] find some way to meaningfully reduce the deficit with

[00:06:14] no tax hikes and without without GDP contraction

[00:06:18] well you you would do it if you got a lot of GDP growth maybe

[00:06:22] right but um if you could if you could meaningfully reduce the deficit with

[00:06:26] with um with no with no tax hikes that would be

[00:06:29] that would be very impressive you know I I think we're sort of sleepwalking

[00:06:33] into Armageddon with uh you know the Ukraine and um

[00:06:37] the conflict and Gau are just sort of the warm-ups to the China Taiwan

[00:06:41] war and uh and so if uh if

[00:06:45] if Trump can find a way to head that off that would be incredible

[00:06:48] if they don't go to war in four years that that would be that would be better than I

[00:06:52] would expect possibly in relation to Taiwan if Trump called you and asked

[00:06:56] should we defend it or not in this acute case

[00:07:00] would you advise to let Taiwan be taken

[00:07:03] by China in order to avoid a nuclear

[00:07:07] Holocaust in World War II or would you believe that

[00:07:10] we should defend it and defend free countries like that well I

[00:07:14] I I think um I think you're probably not supposed to

[00:07:18] say no no no if you no if you um you

[00:07:22] I I I think look I think there's so many ways our our policies are messed

[00:07:26] up but probably you know the one the one thing that's roughly

[00:07:29] correct on the Taiwan policy is that uh uh we

[00:07:33] don't tell China what we're going to do um and what we tell them

[00:07:37] is we don't know what we'll do and we'll figure it out when you do it which is probably has

[00:07:40] the virtue of being correct and uh and then I think if you had

[00:07:44] yeah if you had a red line at quoy Matsu the the island you know five miles

[00:07:48] off the coast of China that's unbelievable if you

[00:07:52] um if you um if you say we want some guard rails and we

[00:07:55] won't defend Taiwan then they'd get invaded right away so I think I think I

[00:07:59] think policy of um not say

[00:08:02] policy is and maybe not even having a policy

[00:08:07] you know in some ways is relatively the best I I I think anything

[00:08:10] anything anything precise you say that's going to just lead to war right away

[00:08:14] but what do you believe I um worth defending or

[00:08:18] not worth starting the conflict democracy in this tiny Island

[00:08:22] worth going to war over or not according to Peter teal it's

[00:08:26] um it's not worth uh it's not worth World War III

[00:08:29] um and I I still think it's it's uh quite catastrophic

[00:08:34] if it uh if it gets taken over by the Communists how does the world those can both be true

[00:08:37] how does the world divide if we end up in

[00:08:41] a heightened escalation is China Russia Iran

[00:08:45] friends is that an Alli is that an axis that forms you know

[00:08:49] think out the next decade in kind of your base case and

[00:08:53] I don't know what happens how the world I don't know what happens militarily if

[00:08:57] there's a China Taiwan Invasion I mean may maybe we roll over

[00:09:01] maybe it escalates you know all the way to nuclear war

[00:09:05] probably it's it's you know some very messy in between

[00:09:09] thing sort of like what what you have in in the Ukraine uh

[00:09:12] what what I think happens economically is very straight forward I think

[00:09:16] uh I think basically um you know you have with Russia

[00:09:19] and Germany you had one northstream Pipeline and we have the equivalent

[00:09:23] of a 100 pipelines between the US and China and they they all

[00:09:27] blow up you I I met the tick tock CEO about about a year

[00:09:30] ago and um you know I not maybe I wouldn't

[00:09:34] have said this now but what I told him and I felt was very honest advice

[00:09:38] was you know you don't need to worry about the us we're never going to do

[00:09:41] anything about Tik Tok we're too incompetent um but

[00:09:45] um but but if I were in your place I would still get the business out of

[00:09:49] China I would get the computers out the people out I'd completely decouple

[00:09:52] it from bike Dan because um Tik Tok will

[00:09:56] be banned 24 hours after the Taiwan invasion

[00:10:00] and if you think there's a 50/50 chance this happens and that will destroy

[00:10:03] you know 100% of the value of the Tik Tok franchise

[00:10:07] what was his reaction um you know

[00:10:11] uh he said that they had done a lot of simulations and the

[00:10:15] bunch of companies in World War I and World War II that managed to sell things to

[00:10:18] both sides he doesn't seem so bright to me do you think he's um

[00:10:22] he no he donly what your take on him he he didn't disagree with my frame and

[00:10:26] so I always I always find that flattering if someone basically framing

[00:10:30] so he seemed he seemed perfectly bright to me even

[00:10:35] though lot of bright people I saw you give this I saw you give

[00:10:38] a talk last summer with Barry Weiss and you talked about this decoupling

[00:10:42] should be happening you weren't saying should you were recommending

[00:10:46] that every industry leader consider decoupling from China I

[00:10:50] think your comment was it's like picking up nickels in front of a freight train you remember

[00:10:53] saying that the well I I I think

[00:10:58] like it's it's there a lot of different there lot of different ways in which

[00:11:01] businesses are coupled to China that were investors that tried

[00:11:05] investing there are people who tried to compete within China they

[00:11:08] people who built factories in China for export um

[00:11:12] and um you know there different parts of that that worked to um to

[00:11:16] to varying degrees but uh but yeah my

[00:11:20] um my I I certainly would not try to

[00:11:24] um to invest in a company that competed

[00:11:27] domestically inside China I think that's that's virtually

[00:11:31] impossible um I think it's

[00:11:35] probably quite tricky even to invest in Chinese Chinese

[00:11:39] businesses um uh and uh and then

[00:11:42] and then there is there is sort of this model of you know building factories

[00:11:46] in China uh for uh for export uh to

[00:11:50] the west and um it was it was a very big Arbitrage these things

[00:11:53] do work you know I me I visited the foxcon factory nine years

[00:11:57] ago and it's you know you have people get paid a dollar and a half $2 an hour

[00:12:01] and they work 12 hours a day and they live in a dorm room with

[00:12:04] two bunk beds where uh you know you get eight people in the dorm room someone's sleeping

[00:12:08] in your bed while you're working and vice versa and uh and you sort of

[00:12:12] realize they're really far behind us or they're really far ahead of us and

[00:12:15] either way you know it's it's not that straightforward to just uh

[00:12:19] shift the um the iPhone factories to the United States um

[00:12:23] so I I sort of understand you know why a lot

[00:12:26] of businesses ended up there and why why this is

[00:12:30] the the arrangement that we have but uh but yeah my my

[00:12:34] my intuition for you know what is going to happen

[00:12:37] without making any normative judgments at all is it is going to decouple

[00:12:42] how inflationary will that be it presumably

[00:12:46] is it's presumably pretty inflationary

[00:12:49] yeah that that's that's probably the you know I I don't know it's

[00:12:54] and you'd have to sort of look at you know what the in elasticities of all these goods

[00:12:57] are so that's true what's the policy re probably not that

[00:13:02] it may not be as inflationary as people think because um

[00:13:05] people always model trade in terms of uh pairwise in terms

[00:13:09] of two countries so if you literally have to move the people back to the US

[00:13:13] that's that's insanely expensive I don't you know I don't know how much would cost people to build

[00:13:17] an iPhone you just you just well I think

[00:13:20] India is sort of too messed up but you shift it to like Vietnam Mexico

[00:13:24] there are you know there there 5 billion people living in countries where

[00:13:28] the incomes are lower than China and so um and

[00:13:31] so you know probably the um the negative sum

[00:13:35] trade policy we should have with China is um you know we

[00:13:39] should just shift it to other countries which is a little bit bad for

[00:13:42] the US extremely bad for China and let's say really

[00:13:46] good for Vietnam that's kind of um and that's kind of

[00:13:50] the the negative sum policy um that

[00:13:53] uh that's going to manifest as this sort of uh decoupling

[00:13:57] happens let's talk about avoiding it for a second here Trump seems to be

[00:14:01] extremely good with dictators and authoritarians uh Kim Jong-un

[00:14:05] seems like a big fan I mean that in like as a compliment as a superpower

[00:14:08] right like he doesn't have a problem talking to them he connects with

[00:14:12] them and they seem to like him so

[00:14:16] what would be the path to him working with XI to avoid this

[00:14:19] is there a path to avoid this because we were sitting here last year

[00:14:23] talking about this and it just seems mindboggling

[00:14:26] that if everybody agrees that this is going to happen happen that we

[00:14:30] can't figure out a way to make it not happen

[00:14:34] well it's it's not just up to us so um

[00:14:38] yeah there's there's and so I don't know

[00:14:41] it's it's obviously somewhat of a black box we don't exactly we we

[00:14:46] I I I feel we just have no clue what people

[00:14:49] in in in China think but um but I I I

[00:14:53] think it's sort of the the sense of history is is strongly

[00:14:56] the sort of thus trap idea that you have a rising power against

[00:15:00] an existing power and it tends to you know it's it's

[00:15:04] willham mean Germany versus Britain before World War I and

[00:15:08] you know it's um you know Athens against Sparta the rising

[00:15:12] power against the existing power you you tend to um get conflict

[00:15:16] that's that's probably what deep down I think

[00:15:20] is is really really far in the China DNA so so

[00:15:24] I'd say maybe maybe the first I don't know the meta version

[00:15:27] would be the first the first step avoiding the conflict would be we have to

[00:15:31] we have to start by admitting that China believes the conflict's

[00:15:34] happening right and then if if if if people like you

[00:15:38] are constantly saying um well we just need to have some happy talk

[00:15:42] right um that's that is a recipe that's a recipe for world

[00:15:46] I'm not advocating happy Jo necessarily um

[00:15:50] I'm I get accused of being a bit more hawkish obviously obviously

[00:15:54] um in in general you know I don't know I I'm not

[00:15:57] I'm not sure Trump should talked to the North Korean dictator but

[00:16:01] yeah in general um it's probably a good idea to to try to

[00:16:05] um talk to people even if they're they're really bad people most of the

[00:16:08] time and uh and uh you know it's it's certainly um a very

[00:16:12] odd Dynamic with the US and and uh and Russia at this

[00:16:15] point where um I I think it is impossible

[00:16:19] for anybody in the Biden Administration even to have a back Channel communication

[00:16:24] with uh with people like I I don't think Tucker Carlson counts as an emissary

[00:16:28] from the Biden Administration and if anybody gets tuckered or I don't know

[00:16:31] what the verb is who talks you know that's that's that seems

[00:16:36] that seems worse than the alternative can we um talk about

[00:16:40] technology um you have this you

[00:16:43] you you have a speech where you talk about some of the misguided things

[00:16:47] we've done in the past in the name of technology and use like big data as an example of

[00:16:51] that um what is

[00:16:54] AI um oh man that's that's

[00:16:58] sort of a big question I

[00:17:01] um it's um yeah

[00:17:05] I I always I I always had this riff where I I don't

[00:17:09] like the buzzwords and um you know machine learning

[00:17:12] learning Big Data cloud computing you know I'm going to build a

[00:17:16] mobile app bring the cloud to um you

[00:17:19] know if you have sort of a concatenation of buzzwords um you know my my first

[00:17:23] instinct is just to run away as fast as possible some really

[00:17:27] bad group think and um and for many years I

[00:17:30] I my bias is probably that AI was one of the worst of all these buzzword

[00:17:34] it meant you know the next generation of computers the last generation

[00:17:38] of computers you know anything in between so it's meant all these

[00:17:42] all these very different things if we if we roll the clock back

[00:17:45] to the 2010s you know the um probably

[00:17:49] the AI to the extent you concretize I would say the AI debate

[00:17:54] was maybe framed by by two the two books the two canonical

[00:17:57] books that framed it was there was the the Bostrom book super intelligence 2014

[00:18:01] where AI was going to be this super human super duper intelligent

[00:18:05] um thing and then um the anti- um

[00:18:09] Boston book was the Kaiu Lee 2018 AI superpowers you can think

[00:18:13] of the CCP rebuttal to Bostrom where basically AI

[00:18:17] was going to be surveillance Tech face recognition and

[00:18:20] China was going to win because they had no qualms about uh applying this

[00:18:24] technology and um and then um if we now think about

[00:18:28] what actually happened let's say with the llms and and chat GPT

[00:18:32] it was really neither of those two um and it was

[00:18:35] this in between thing which was actually what people would have defined AI

[00:18:39] as for the previous 60 or 70 years which is passing the touring

[00:18:43] test which is you know this the somewhat fuzzy line it's a computer

[00:18:47] that can pretend to be a human um or that can fool

[00:18:50] you into thinking it's a human and um and uh

[00:18:54] you know even with the fuzziness of that line you could say that pre

[00:18:58] chat GPT wasn't passed and then chat GPT passed

[00:19:02] it and that seems that seems very very significant

[00:19:06] um and um and then obviously leads to all these questions

[00:19:10] what does it mean you know is it going to is it going to complement people

[00:19:13] is it going to substitute for people you know what does it do to the labor market

[00:19:17] do you get paid more paid less you know so there all these all these

[00:19:21] questions but uh it um it seems extremely

[00:19:24] it seems extremely important um and um

[00:19:29] and it's probably you know certainly the the big picture

[00:19:33] questions which I think Silicon Valley is always very bad at talking about is like you know what does

[00:19:36] it mean to be a human being right um sort of the I don't know the stupid

[00:19:41] 2022 answer would be that humans differ from all the other animals

[00:19:44] because we we're good at languages if you're a three-year-old or an 80-year old you

[00:19:48] speak you communicate we tell each other stories this this

[00:19:52] this is what makes us different and so um so yeah I think there's something

[00:19:55] about it that's uh incredibly important and and very disorienting

[00:20:00] you know the question I always have as a I know the narrower question I have as an investor

[00:20:03] is sort of how do you make money with this stuff and um

[00:20:07] how do you make money I it's um it's pretty

[00:20:11] confusing and I think I I don't know this is always where I'm anchored

[00:20:14] on the late 90s is sort of the formative period for me but

[00:20:18] uh I I I I keep thinking that uh AI

[00:20:22] in 20123 2024 is like the internet in

[00:20:26] 1999 um it's it's really big it's going to

[00:20:29] be very important it's going to transform the world not

[00:20:33] you know in 6 months but in 20 years and then

[00:20:37] um there are probably all kinds of incredibly uh

[00:20:40] catastrophic approximations where you know

[00:20:44] uh what businesses are going to make money you know who's going to have the Monopoly who's going to

[00:20:48] have pricing power is um you know is is is is

[00:20:51] super unclear um probably you know one one layer

[00:20:55] deeper of analysis you know if attention is all you need and if you're you're not

[00:20:58] post economic you need to pay attention to who's making money and in AI

[00:21:02] it's basically one company is making Nvidia is making over

[00:21:06] 100% of the profits everybody else is collectively losing money

[00:21:09] and so um and so there's sort of a you have to do some

[00:21:13] sort of you should do you should try to do some sort of analysis you

[00:21:17] do you go long Nvidia do you go short you know is it um you

[00:21:21] know My Monopoly question is it a is it a really durable Monopoly

[00:21:24] you know and and then I it's it's hard for me to know because I'm in Silicon Valley

[00:21:28] and I haven't done anything we haven't done anything in semiconductors for a long time so I have

[00:21:31] no clue do you um if you let's debz word the word Ai and say

[00:21:35] it's a bunch of process automation let's just say that's version 0.1

[00:21:39] where brains that are roughly the equivalent of a teenager can do a lot of

[00:21:44] manual stuff what do you have you thought about what it means

[00:21:47] for you know 8 billion people in the world if

[00:21:51] there's an extra billion that necessarily couldn't work or like

[00:21:54] whether that in political or economic terms

[00:21:59] I don't know the the the um

[00:22:02] I I I don't know if this is the same but this is you know the the history of

[00:22:06] 2050 years the Industrial Revolution what was

[00:22:09] that it you know it adds to GDP it frees people

[00:22:13] up to do more more productive things um you know maybe

[00:22:17] there's you know there was yeah there was a I know there was a lite critique in the 19th

[00:22:21] century of the factories that people were going to be unemployed and wouldn't

[00:22:24] have anything to do because the machines would replace the people you know maybe the

[00:22:28] Lites are right this time around I'm I'm I'm probably

[00:22:32] I'm probably pretty pretty skeptical of it but uh but yeah it's it's it's extremely

[00:22:36] confusing you know uh where where the gains and

[00:22:41] and losses are there there probably are um

[00:22:44] you know there there's always sort of a hobby you can always just use it on your hobby

[00:22:48] horses so I don't know the you know my anti- Hollywood or anti- university

[00:22:52] hobby horse is that uh it seems to me that you know

[00:22:56] the um the AI is quite good at the woke stuff and

[00:22:59] um it'll and and so you know if you want to if you want to be a successful actor

[00:23:03] you should be maybe a little bit racist or a little bit sexist or just really funny

[00:23:08] uh and you won't have any risk of the AI replacing

[00:23:11] you everybody else will get everybody else will get replaced

[00:23:15] and then probably I don't know um

[00:23:19] I don't know uh Claudine gay the plagiarizing Harvard University

[00:23:23] president um you know the AI is going to you know the AI

[00:23:27] will produce end amounts of um of these

[00:23:30] sort of I don't even know what to call them uh woke

[00:23:34] um papers and um they they were

[00:23:38] all already sort of plagiarizing one another they were because they were always saying the same

[00:23:41] thing over and over again they were using their own version of is just going to flood

[00:23:45] the Zone with with even more of that and that you know I don't know obviously

[00:23:49] they've been able to do it for a long time and no one's noticed but uh but I think I think

[00:23:52] at this point um that it it doesn't seem promising

[00:23:56] from a um compet compe Point obviously

[00:23:59] my hobby horses so I'm I'm just maybe just wishful thinking on my part

[00:24:03] what are the areas of technology that um you're curious about that your

[00:24:07] mind is like wow this is really I have to learn more pay

[00:24:11] attention you know I'm always I always think

[00:24:15] uh you you want to instantiate it more

[00:24:18] in companies than than um things or you know you ask

[00:24:22] sort of like where is where is innovation happening

[00:24:25] you um you know it it it in

[00:24:29] our society it doesn't have to be this way but it's it's

[00:24:32] um it's mostly in in um in a certain subset

[00:24:36] of relatively small companies where we have these relatively small teams

[00:24:40] of people that are really pushing the envelope and that's

[00:24:44] that's sort of you know that that's sort of what I find

[00:24:47] you know inspiring about about venture capital and then you

[00:24:51] and then obviously you don't just want Innovation you also want it to sort

[00:24:54] it to it to um to translate into into good businesses

[00:24:58] but that's that's where it happens it it somehow it doesn't happen in universities

[00:25:02] it doesn't happen in government you know there was a time it did I mean

[00:25:06] you know somehow in this very very weird different

[00:25:10] country that was the United States in the 1940s you had you know somehow

[00:25:14] the Army organized the scientists and got them to produce a nuclear bomb in Los

[00:25:17] Alamos in three and a half years and you know the way the New York Times

[00:25:21] editorialized after that was you know it's it's you know it was sort

[00:25:24] of an anti-libertarian write up it was you know there were um you know obvious Maybe

[00:25:28] you'd left the Primadonna scientists to their own would have taken them 50 years

[00:25:32] to build a bomb and uh the Army could just tell them what to do and this

[00:25:35] will should silence anybody who doesn't believe the government can do things

[00:25:39] and uh they don't write editorials like that in the New York Times

[00:25:43] anymore but I think um yeah but I think that's sort of

[00:25:47] that that's that's sort of where where when where when should look I think it I think

[00:25:51] I think a crazy amount of it still happens in the United States

[00:25:54] you know there sort of you know we've we've you know episodically tried to

[00:25:58] all this investing we probably tried to do tooo much investing in Europe over the years

[00:26:01] it's always sort of a junk it sort of it's a nice place to go on vacation

[00:26:05] as an investor and um and it's it's it is it

[00:26:09] is very it's it's very and I don't have a great

[00:26:12] explanation but it's a very strange thing that uh so much of

[00:26:16] it is still the US is somehow still the country where people do new

[00:26:19] things Peter is that is that a team organizational

[00:26:23] social evolutionary problem in the United States what is the

[00:26:27] root cause of the failure to innovate in the United States

[00:26:30] relative to the expectation going back 70

[00:26:34] years 50 years Etc from you know the the rocket

[00:26:38] shift and we're all going to live yeah well this is always this is always this always one of the big

[00:26:41] picture and claims I have that we've been in an era of relative

[00:26:45] Tech stagnation the last 40 or 50 years or the you know the tagline

[00:26:50] um that we had they promis flying cars

[00:26:53] all we got was 140 characters which is not an anti- Twitter antix

[00:26:57] commentary even though the the way the way I used to always qualify it was that

[00:27:01] uh at least you know at least it was at least a good company you had

[00:27:04] you know 10,000 people who didn't have to do very much work and could just smoke

[00:27:08] marijuana all day very similar to Europe and so I I think that actually

[00:27:11] that part actually did get corrected but um um

[00:27:16] but the um very but I think I I think um

[00:27:20] like what went wrong because you you point out that it's not a technology Trend tracker

[00:27:23] that you think about it's about people and teams that innovate and drive to outcomes

[00:27:28] B on their view of the world and and what's gone wrong with our

[00:27:31] view of the world and our ability to organize to achieve

[00:27:35] the seemingly unachievable with very rare exceptions obviously elon's here later

[00:27:38] but yeah you know it's it's it's it's overdetermined um

[00:27:43] the um the the the rough frame I always have and again

[00:27:46] it's not that there's been no innovation there's been there's been a decent amount of

[00:27:50] innovation in the world of bits computers internet mobile

[00:27:54] internet you know crypto AI so there sort of all

[00:27:57] these um world of bits uh places

[00:28:01] where there was you know a sign significant but sort of

[00:28:05] somehow narrow cone of progress but it was everything having to do with atams

[00:28:08] that was slow this was already the case When I Was An undergraduate at Stanford in the late 80s

[00:28:12] in retrospect any applied engineering field was a bad

[00:28:16] idea it was a bad idea to become a chemical engineer you know a mechanical engineer

[00:28:20] aeroastro was terrible nuclear engineering everyone KN

[00:28:23] I mean I no one did that you know and um

[00:28:27] and and there's something about yeah the world of Adams that um

[00:28:31] you know from a Libertarian point of view you'd say got regulated to death

[00:28:35] um there probably uh you know there's there's some

[00:28:38] there's some set of arguments where um the lwh hanging fruit

[00:28:42] got picked and got harder to find new things to do although I always

[00:28:46] I always think that was just a sort of baby boomer excuse for for covering

[00:28:50] up for the the failures of that generation um and

[00:28:53] um and then um and then I think but I think

[00:28:57] maybe maybe um maybe a very big picture part

[00:29:00] of it was that uh at some point in the

[00:29:04] 20th century the idea got took hold that not all

[00:29:08] forms of technological progress were simply good

[00:29:12] and simply for the better and there's you know there's something about the two world

[00:29:15] wars and the you know the development of nuclear weapons that uh

[00:29:19] that that gradually pushed people into this this more uh risk ofers society

[00:29:23] and it didn't happen overnight but um you know maybe a quarter

[00:29:27] century you know after the nuclear bomb it's like by Woodstock it happened

[00:29:31] by Woodstock it happened yeah cuz that was the same summer we landed on the moon

[00:29:35] yeah Woodstock was three weeks after that yeah that's that was the Tipping

[00:29:39] Point progress stopped in the took over sex can we shift gears

[00:29:42] just to the domestic economy what what do you think's happening in the domestic economy and just

[00:29:46] say backdrop we've had something like 14 straight months of

[00:29:49] downward revisions to jobs the revisions are supposed to be completely random

[00:29:53] but somehow they've all been down um prob doesn't mean anything

[00:29:57] um there's also what's happening with with the yield curve but I'll stop

[00:30:01] there what what's your take on what's happening in the economy

[00:30:07] um you know it's it's

[00:30:10] man it's always hard hard to know exactly yeah I I I suspect we're close

[00:30:14] to a recession i' I've probably thought this for a while

[00:30:18] uh it's it's being stopped by really

[00:30:21] big government spending so um you know in May of

[00:30:26] 2023 the projection for the deficit

[00:30:29] in 20 fiscal year 24 which is October of 23 to September

[00:30:33] 24 was something like 1.5 1.6 trillion

[00:30:37] um the deficit is going to come in about 400 billion higher and

[00:30:41] so um which you know was a sort of a crazy deficit was projected

[00:30:45] and it was way off and then somehow um

[00:30:48] and so if if we had not found another 400 billion

[00:30:53] um to add to you know this this crazy deficit at the

[00:30:57] top of the economics cycle you know you're supposed to you're supposed to increase

[00:31:00] deficits in a recession not at the not at the top of the cycle

[00:31:04] um you know think things would be probably very shaky there's yeah there's

[00:31:08] there's there's there's some way where um we yeah we have

[00:31:12] a um too much debt not enough sustainable growth

[00:31:16] um you know again I always think it comes back to you know Tech

[00:31:20] Innovation there probably are other ways to grow an economy without

[00:31:24] Tech um or intensive progress um

[00:31:28] but I think they we we we don't have those don't seem to

[00:31:31] be on offer and then that's that's where it's very deeply stuck if you if you wind back

[00:31:35] over the last 50 years you there's always a question why did people not

[00:31:38] realize that this Tech stagnation had happened sooner and I think there were two

[00:31:42] one-time things people could do economically that had nothing to do with

[00:31:46] science or tech there was a 1980s Reagan Thatcher

[00:31:50] move which was to massively cut taxes deregulate

[00:31:54] allow lots of companies to merge and combine and and

[00:31:58] it was sort of a one-time way to make the economy a

[00:32:01] lot bigger even though it had it was not something that really had the

[00:32:05] sort of compounding effect so it led to one great decade

[00:32:09] and then there was um you know and that was sort of the right-wing capitalist

[00:32:12] move and then um in the 90s there was sort of a Clinton

[00:32:16] Blair um Center left thing which was sort of Leaning into

[00:32:20] globalization and there was a giant Global Arbitrage you

[00:32:23] could do which also had you know a lot of negative externalities that came with it

[00:32:27] but um it sort of was a one-time move I think both of those are

[00:32:31] are not on offer you know I don't necessarily

[00:32:34] think you should undo globalization I don't think you should raise taxes like crazy

[00:32:39] but um you can't you can't do more globalization or more

[00:32:42] tax cuts here that's not going to be the win and and so I I think you have to somehow get

[00:32:46] back to the future um we have time for a couple more questions

[00:32:50] you um I think saw that maybe this ivy league

[00:32:54] institutions maybe weren't producing the best and brightest or weren't

[00:32:58] exactly um hitting their mandate um and you created the teal

[00:33:01] fellows and you've been doing that for a while and I meet them all because they all have crazy

[00:33:05] ideas and they pitch me for Angel investment what have you learned

[00:33:09] getting people to quit school giving them $100,000 and then how

[00:33:12] many parents call you and get really upset that their kids are quitting

[00:33:16] school uh it's

[00:33:21] well I I don't know I've I've I've learned a

[00:33:24] lot I mean it's it's um

[00:33:30] I don't know I I I I think I think the universities are far worse than I even

[00:33:33] thought when I started this thing um I think

[00:33:37] um yeah it's um you know I I

[00:33:41] I I did this uh I did this debate at Yale

[00:33:44] last week um you know resolved higher education's a bubble

[00:33:48] and um and uh you sort of go through all the different

[00:33:53] numbers and um the and then you know

[00:33:56] and again I I was ful to word it in such a way that I I didn't have to you

[00:34:00] know and then people kept saying well what's your alternative what should people do instead and I said nope that's not

[00:34:03] was not the debate I'm not you know I'm not your guidance counselor I'm not your

[00:34:07] career counselor I I don't know how to solve your problems but um

[00:34:11] if something's a bubble you know the first thing you should do is probably not

[00:34:15] you know lean into it in too crazy a way and you

[00:34:19] know the student debt was 300 billion in 2000 it's

[00:34:22] uh it's basically uh close to two trillion at this point so it's just been

[00:34:26] the sort of runaway um this runaway process

[00:34:30] and um and then if you look at it by cohort if you graduated

[00:34:33] from college in 1997 12 years later

[00:34:37] um people still had student debt but most of the people had sort of paid it down

[00:34:41] um but the first by 2009 we started the teal Fellowship

[00:34:45] in 2010 and it you know it felt uh two by

[00:34:49] 2009 was the first cohort where this really stopped

[00:34:53] if you take the people graduated from college in 2009 and you fast

[00:34:57] for forward 12 years to 2021

[00:35:01] the median person had more student debt

[00:35:05] 12 years later than they graduated with because

[00:35:09] it's actually just it's just compounding faster and it was you know partially partially

[00:35:13] the global financial crisis the people had less well-paying jobs they stayed

[00:35:16] in college longer um and the colleges

[00:35:20] they it's just sort of been this background thing where it's it's decayed

[00:35:24] in these in these really significant ways and um you know

[00:35:28] again I I think it's on some level um there are sort of a lot

[00:35:31] of um debates in our society that are probably dominated by sort of a

[00:35:35] boomer narrative and maybe the Baby Boomers were the

[00:35:38] last generation where College really worked and you know they

[00:35:42] think well you know I I worked my way through college and why can't

[00:35:46] why can't um why can't you know an 18-year-old going to college do that

[00:35:49] today and um and so I I I think

[00:35:53] the bubble will will will be done once the Boomers have

[00:35:57] exited stage left but does the government to it would be good if we

[00:36:00] figured something out before then you know does does the government need to stop

[00:36:04] underwriting the loans because it's the lending I think the 90

[00:36:08] plus perc of the the the capital in the student loan programs is

[00:36:12] funded by federal uh Federal the federal government

[00:36:16] and there's if you're an accredited University you can take out a loan and go to it

[00:36:20] and accreditation in in a in a in a rigid kind of

[00:36:23] free market system you would have an underwriter that says are you going to be able to

[00:36:27] Gra graduate make enough money to pay your loan off is this a good school are you going to

[00:36:30] get a good job and then the market would figure out whether or not to give you a loan would figure out

[00:36:34] what the rate should be and so on but in this case the government simply provides Capital

[00:36:38] to support all this and as a result everything's gotten more expensive

[00:36:42] and the rigidity in the system that basically qualifies schools and the

[00:36:46] quality of those schools relative to the earning potential over time is gone

[00:36:49] we need the government to get out of student loan business yeah but look the

[00:36:53] the place where I'm I I know I'm sort of some ways I'm rightwing some ways

[00:36:57] I'm left wing on this so the place where I'm leftwing is I

[00:37:00] do think a lot of the students got ripped off and uh and so I think there

[00:37:04] should be some kind of broad um debt forgiveness

[00:37:08] at this point um who should pick up the T but it's not just the taxpayers

[00:37:12] it's the universities and it's the the the the bond holders

[00:37:16] got it the bond take a little bit out of those ends the universities

[00:37:20] and um and then obviously if you just make it the

[00:37:24] taxpayers then um then you'll just then the universities can just

[00:37:27] charge more and more no incentive to reform what whatsoever

[00:37:31] but uh had me you know it's in 2005

[00:37:35] uh it was under Bush 43 that the bankruptcy laws got Rewritten

[00:37:38] in the US where you cannot discharge student debt even if you go bankrupt

[00:37:42] and if you haven't paid it off by the time you're 65 your Social Security wages

[00:37:47] checks will be garnished it's crazy so um so you know

[00:37:50] I I I I do think um but should we stop lending should the federal government

[00:37:54] get out of the the student lending business well if if if we if we say

[00:37:58] that uh if we if we start if we start with my place

[00:38:02] where you know a lot of the student debt should be forgiven and then

[00:38:06] and then and then reform the then we'll see how many people are willing to lend

[00:38:10] you know how how much how many of the colleges can um pay for all the student

[00:38:14] what's your sense if if it was a totally free market system how many colleges

[00:38:18] would shut down because they wouldn't be able to S there's no tuition

[00:38:24] support it it probably would be a lot smaller

[00:38:28] it it might it might you might not have to shut

[00:38:31] them down because there's you know a lot of them have gotten extremely

[00:38:35] a blow it's like Bal Mall's cost disease where you know I don't know if

[00:38:39] I have no idea like a place like UCLA it probably has

[00:38:42] you know twice or three times as many bureaucrats as they had

[00:38:46] 30 40 years ago so there's sort of all there's sort of all these sort of

[00:38:50] um parasitic people that have sort of uh gradually approved

[00:38:54] and uh and um and and so there's probably a lot of would be a lot

[00:38:57] of rational ways to dial this back but um but yeah um you

[00:39:01] know maybe we're to a new location if the only if

[00:39:04] the only way to lose weight is to cut off your thumb that's kind of a difficult way to go

[00:39:08] on a DI he um Peter three of your collaborators longtime

[00:39:12] collaborators Elon Musk um

[00:39:15] Mark Zuckerberg and uh Sam mman are

[00:39:20] arguably the three leading AI language model

[00:39:24] um leaders which one is going to win rank in

[00:39:27] order and tell us a little bit about

[00:39:33] each Peter said he would answer any question I I I I I said

[00:39:36] I would take any question I didn't say to answer any question you

[00:39:40] said you would honestly you said today you felt extremely honest and candid

[00:39:43] Let's uh I I yeah but Ive already been extremely honest and candid

[00:39:47] so I think qu it's

[00:39:51] it's it's whoever I talked to last okay

[00:39:54] they're they're all very very convincing people so you know I cre I

[00:39:58] I talk a little bit I talked to Elon

[00:40:02] a while ago and and you know and it was it was just

[00:40:05] um how ridiculous it was that Sam Alman was getting away

[00:40:09] with turning open AI from a nonprofit into a for-profit

[00:40:13] that was such a scam if everybody was allowed to do this everybody

[00:40:17] would do this that it has to be totally illegal what Sam's

[00:40:21] doing and it shouldn't be allowed at all and that seemed

[00:40:24] really really convincing in the moment and then then sort of half an hour later

[00:40:28] I I thought to myself but you know actually um man

[00:40:32] it was it's been such a horrifically mismanaged

[00:40:36] place at open AI with this Preposterous nonprofit board

[00:40:40] they had nobody would do this again and so there actually isn't

[00:40:44] much of a moral hazard from it so but yeah who whoever whoever I talk to

[00:40:47] I find very convincing in the moment well will that spaces

[00:40:51] get commoditized I mean do you see a path to Monopoly there well

[00:40:55] again this is this is again where you know you should you know attention

[00:40:59] is all you need you need to pay attention to who's making money it's Nvidia

[00:41:03] it's it's the hardware the chips layer and

[00:41:06] um and um and then that's just it's just what

[00:41:10] we you know it's not what we've done in tech for for 30 years

[00:41:14] you are they making 120% of the profits they're

[00:41:18] they're make they're I think everybody else is losing money collectively yeah everyone

[00:41:22] else is just spending money on on the computer so it's it's one it's one company that's

[00:41:25] making I mean maybe there's a few other people are making some money I mean I assume tsmc and

[00:41:29] asml but but uh but uh yeah I think everyone else is collectively

[00:41:33] losing money what do you think of Zuckerberg's approach to say I'm so far behind

[00:41:37] this isn't cour in my business I'm going to open source it

[00:41:41] um is that going to be the winning strategy handicap that for

[00:41:46] us um again I I I I I

[00:41:50] I I would say um my

[00:41:53] again my my my big my my big qualification is you know my my

[00:41:57] model is AI feels like it does feel uncomfortably

[00:42:00] close to the bubble of 1999 so I'm

[00:42:04] we haven't invested that much in it um

[00:42:08] and uh I I I'd want to have more clarity in investing

[00:42:12] but uh but the the uh the simple simplistic question

[00:42:15] is you know who who's going to make money um

[00:42:19] you know I think a year ago two years ago in retrospect Nvidia would have been a good buy

[00:42:23] you know I think at this point everybody it's it's it's sort of too obvious that they're making

[00:42:26] too much money everyone's going to try to copy them on on the chip

[00:42:30] side maybe that's straightforward to do maybe it's not

[00:42:34] but but that's you know I'd say probably

[00:42:37] um you should you should if you if you want to figure out the AI thing you you should

[00:42:41] not be asking this question about um you know meta or

[00:42:45] um open air or any of these things you should really be focusing on the Nvidia

[00:42:48] question the chips question and the the fact that we're not able to focus on that

[00:42:52] that that tells us something about how we've all been trained you know I think Nvidia got started in

[00:42:55] 1993 yeah I believe that was the last year

[00:42:59] where anybody in their right mind would have studied electrical engineering over computer

[00:43:03] science right 94 Netscape takes off and then yeah

[00:43:06] it's probably a really bad idea to start a Semiconductor Company even in '93

[00:43:10] but the benefit is there was going to be no one would come after

[00:43:14] you no no talented people started semiconductor companies after 1993

[00:43:18] because they all went into you know into software score

[00:43:22] their Monopoly power um

[00:43:26] it's

[00:43:30] I I I think it's quite strong because this this this

[00:43:34] history that I just gave you where none of us know anything about chips

[00:43:38] um and then I think the you know I think the

[00:43:42] risk it's always you know if attention is all that you need

[00:43:46] um the qualifier to that is you know when you get started as

[00:43:50] an you know actress as a startup as a as a company

[00:43:54] you need attention then it's desirable to get more and at some

[00:43:57] point attention becomes the worst thing in the world and and there was the

[00:44:01] one day where Nvidia had the largest market cap

[00:44:05] in the world earlier this year and I do think that represented a phase

[00:44:09] transition once that happened they probably had um

[00:44:12] more attention than was good hey Peter as we wrap here

[00:44:16] um your brain works in a unique way you're an incredible

[00:44:19] strategist you think you know very differently than

[00:44:23] uh a lot of the folks um that we get to talk to

[00:44:27] um with all of this are you optimistic for the

[00:44:32] future uh I I always man I always push back in that question

[00:44:36] I I um I think I

[00:44:40] think extreme optimism and extreme pessimism are

[00:44:43] both really bad attitudes and they're the somehow

[00:44:47] the same thing you know extreme pessimism nothing you

[00:44:50] can do extreme optimism the future will take care of itself

[00:44:54] so if if you have to have one it's probably you want to be somewhere in between maybe

[00:44:58] mildly optimistic mildly pessimistic but uh

[00:45:02] you know I I believe in human agency and that it's up to us

[00:45:05] and it's not you know it's not some sort of winning a lottery ticket or

[00:45:09] some astrological chart that's going to decide things and I

[00:45:13] believe in human agency and that's sort of an axis that's very different

[00:45:17] from optimism or pessimism what a great extreme optimism extreme pessimism

[00:45:21] they're both excuses for laziness what an amazing place to end

[00:45:24] ladies and gentlemen give it up for Peter J thank you thank you Peter

[00:45:28] come on now wow all right Peter ch
